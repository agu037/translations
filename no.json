GAMSTOP is not responsible for returning funds. You will not be able to cancel your self-exclusion until your chosen minimum period has elapsed.

        "history_body": "Fantasy oppsto i USA på slutten av 1950-tallet, da Bill Winkenbach først dro i gang fantasy for golf og baseball, og noen få år senere fantasy for amerikansk fotball. Det ble ganske stort i 1990, da en rekke amerikanske aviser begynte å dekke nasjonale konkurranser.   \n\nBrukeropplevelsen ble forbedret kraftig da man kunne tilby konkurranser online mer enn et tiår senere, og omsetningen vokste kraftig. Snart var det snakk om en bransje som omsatte for en milliard dollar! Etter hvert kom selskaper som DraftKings og FanDuel på banen og ble de to største operatørene i USA for konkurranser med pengeinnsatser og pengepremier.  \n\n I Europa har Scout Gaming Group vært den ledende arrangøren av daglig fantasy sport for penger i cirka fem år, mens Premier League har et eget gratis sesongspill med flere millioner deltagere.",

        "game_rules_body": "I fantasy-turneringer spiller man mot andre spillere, og konkurrerer om en pott som består av samtlige innkjøp i turneringen minus avgift. Jo mer fantasy-poeng laget får, jo høyere opp på premielisten kommer man. Som hovedregel er det mange premier i en turnering, ofte rundt en femtedel av det totale antall deltagere. \n\nDet finnes egne regler for hvert sport som avgjør hvordan hendelser blir belønnet med fantasy-poeng.\nRegler for poengberegning finner du her",
        "game_types_body": "##### Daglig fantasy:\nDe fleste turneringene er av denne typen, som går over kortere tid. Alt fra et par timer og opp til et par uker. Når du setter opp et lag i en slik turnering, kan du som regel ikke gjøre endringer etter at turneringen har startet. Et typisk eksempel er Premier League full runde, som typisk blir ferdigspilt i løpet av en helg.  \n\n##### Sesongspill:\nFantasy-turneringer som varer lenger. Du starter med et lag og kan gjøre små endringer på dette laget for hver runde. Premier League har en slik som går over hele sesongen. For å kunne delta, må du melde deg på i begynnelsen av sesongen. Vi kaller det også sesongspill om turneringen går over noen måneder, for eksempel gruppespillet i Champions League.    \n\n##### Standard fantasy:\nDu får et visst pengebeløp for å kjøpe spillere, og må holde deg innenfor budsjettet. Spillerne tjener fantasy-poeng avhengig av hvor godt de gjør det i kampene sine. Du får doble poeng for kapteinen din.  \n\n##### Jaktstart:\nHer er det ingen grenser for hvor mye penger du kan kjøpe spillere for, men hvis du gjør smarte kjøp og sparer penger, får du bonuspoeng som kan hjelpe deg å vinne turneringen. Se etter spillere som du mener er priset for lavt i forhold til potensialet, og det er helt greit om du bare bruker halvparten av budsjettet. Kapteinen får doble poeng, men koster også dobbelt i Jaktstart.",

        "tips_and_tricks_body": "Spiller du standard fantasy med et budsjett, så bør du bruke mest mulig av budsjettet som er tilgjengelig. Ikke la mer enn 1.5M stå igjen ubrukt! Dette er fordi dyrere spillere nesten alltid har større poeng-potensiale.  \nSpiller du derimot Jaktstart, vil du få bonuspoeng hvis du setter opp et sterkt lag uten å bruke opp alle pengene. Vinnerne i dette spillet har ofte valgt seg noen billige spillere som de mener er priset for lavt i forhold til potensialet.  \n\nI fotball kan det være lurt å velge flere spillere fra samme lag, og kanskje særlig defensive spillere (forsvarere og keepere). Vær imidlertid klar over at man blir straffet med minuspoeng jo flere defensive spillere man har fra et bestemt lag. I standard fantasy er det derfor uvanlig å ha mer enn 2 defensive fra samme lag. I Jaktstart går det an å ha 3, og av og til 4.  \n\nI standard fantasy bør din kaptein være en av dine dyreste spillere. I jaktstart er det mer åpent. Her gjelder det å velge den spilleren som er mest underpriset - altså den man tror vil gi best valuta for pengene.\nPrøv å unngå å velge spillere som spiller mot hverandre. Spesielt er det dårlig spill å ha forsvarere fra et lag, og angripere fra det laget som er motstander.  \n\nNår du leter etter gode forsvarsspillere, kan du bruke oddsen laget har for å holde nullen. Jo lavere odds, jo bedre sjanse har spilleren for å få en slik bonus. En odds rundt 2.00 er bra.\nNår du leter etter angrepsspillere, kan du bruke oddsen for at vedkommende kommer til å score. For en utespiller bør oddsen være lavere enn 6, og gjerne lavere enn 3.\nHvis du mener at sjansen for at et lag vinner er større enn kampoddsen gjenspeiler, så vil spillere fra dette laget være gunstig priset for deg, siden kampoddsen blir tatt i betraktning når prisene settes.",
        "what_is_fantasy_body": "Fantasy er et sportsspill hvor deltagerne setter opp et drømmelag ved å velge utøvere de tror kommer til å gjøre det bra i virkelige sportsbegivenheter. Den mest populære sporten er fotball. Her gjelder det å velge spillere som har en god sjanse til å score, til å gi målgivende pasning, eller til å holde nullen. \n\nAlle sporter har sin egen liste over hendelser som gir poeng og denne listen bør du sjekke før du setter opp drømmelaget ditt. Hvis spillerne på laget ditt utmerker seg, får du mange poeng, og kan kjempe om seieren i fantasy-turneringen.",

        "words_and_concepts_body": "##### Sikkerhetsnett \nNoen sporter har en automatisk funksjon som gir deg en erstatningsspiller, hvis den du valgte opprinnelig ikke er med i kampen fra start. Sikkerhetsnett vil ikke være aktivert i turneringer som har reserver valgt av brukeren.  \n\nStacking penalty \nBrukes ofte i fotballturneringer. Jo flere defensive spillere du har fra en og samme klubb, jo mindre poeng vil spillerne dine få for å holde nullen. Spiller nummer to vil få 3 poeng for å holde nullen, spiller nummer tre vil få 2 poeng, og spiller nummer fire 1 poeng. Regelen er innført for å redusere den klare fordelen man ellers ville hatt av å velge mange defensive spillere fra samme lag. Keeper og forsvarere teller begge med som defensive spillere.  \n\nHurtigvelger \nEn rask og enkel løsning hvis du ikke vet selv hvilke spillere du ønsker deg.\n\nGarantert premiepott \nForteller hvor stor premiepotten minst vil bli. Selv med mindre deltagere enn ventet, så vil turneringen utbetale denne premiepotten. Blir det flere deltagere enn garantien er basert på, vil selvsagt premiepotten øke utover garantien.  \n\nLagre lag \nHvis du har tenkt til å levere flere lag som er nokså like, kan du lagre stammen (eller hele laget) og raskt hente det opp igjen på et senere tidspunkt. Du finner funksjonene i menyen med de tre prikkene til høyre i vinduet.  \n\nJaktstart \nEn variant av fantasy hvor du får bonuspoeng for å velge billigere spillere. Dette betyr at de billige lagene starter turneringen med et forsprang, og blir ‘jaktet på’ av de dyrere lagene som har presumptivt bedre spillere.",

This is an opportunity to think strategically as you&#39;ll want to choose the driver that you think will score you the most points so that you can maximise your 25% boost.\n\n### Underdog\n\nYou can also earn a 25% boost on the cheapest driver or constructor on your team. This is an opportunity to choose someone scrappy that will punch above their weight and get you a lot of value for money.\n\n## Other interesting links\n\nWant to learn more about fantasy Formula One?

You pick the players you like the best for your team and watch them gain fantasy points based on their performance in real-world games. For example are points given for scoring a goal in football. The points standings are updated in real time, so it can be quite exciting!   \nIn most cases, you need to pay some money to participate, and there are money prizes you can win. A small part of the buy-in is taken out of the prize pool as an administration fee, while the rest is distributed to the winners of the tournament. Usually, there are a lot of prizes!   \n\nThere are two types of fantasy tournaments:   \n- Season-long   \n- Daily fantasy   \n\nSeason-long is perhaps the most well-known format, where you compete for all 38 gameweeks of the Premier League (or some other league). You start out with a squad of players and make small changes from one gameweek to the next. Prizes are paid out at the end of the season.   \n\nIn daily fantasy, you compete for a day or a weekend or perhaps for a week. You can enter a team on Saturday and get your winnings on Monday! In daily fantasy you start out with a brand new team for each tournament you enter, and there are no changes made after the tournament has started.",

        "some_answer_soccer_0": "![Football player](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg.net/support-pages/sgn-footballmini.jpg){.right .ml-s .m-s}   \nThere are several available formats for football tournaments.   \n\n**Classic format seasonal**   \nThe original format, used for PL season game, and some other seasonal games. 15 players, including 4 subs. No safety net. No stacking penalty. There is a budget. There is a captain and a vice captain. The captain gets double points, the vice captain gets double points if the captain does not play at all in the gameweek.  \n\n**New format seasonal**   \nSome seasonal tournaments - like Champions League group stage - will have 11 players, no subs, but safety net. No stacking penalty. There is a budget. There is a captain and a vice captain. The captain gets double points, the vice captain gets double points if the captain does not play at all in the gameweek. \n\n**Classic format daily fantasy**   \nFor big tournaments with more than 5 matches, we often use this format. A good example is The Weekly Monster. 11 players, no subs, safety net is enabled. Stacking penalty is enabled. There is a budget. There is a captain and a vice captain. The captain gets double points, the vice captain gets double points if the captain does not play at all in the gameweek. \n\n**Universal 6**   \nThis is a newly developed format aimed at tournaments with few matches. You will see this format in many different sports. 6 players, not subs, safety net is enabled. Stacking penalty is enabled. There is a budget. There is a captain and a vice captain. The captain gets 1.5 x the points, but he also costs 1.5 x the price! Same for vice captain, but he gets 1.2 x the points.  \n \n**Normal – 11 players**       \nWorks well when there are 5 or more matches in the tournament.\n    Allowed formations: 5-4-1, 5-3-2, 4-3-3,\n                        4-4-2, 4-5-1, 3-5-2,\n                        3-4-3, 5-2-3    \n**Flexi 5**    \nChoose only five players. Formations are flexible. Works well when there are less than 6 matches in the tournament. Especially well suited for single matches.   \n\n**Flexi X**       \nThe number of players can be any from 3 to 11. Formations are flexible. Can be used for tournaments that have any number of matches. \n\nThere are also these, which are not commonly used by official tournaments:   \nSix-A-Side – 6 players    \n    Allowed formations: 2-2-1, 2-1-2, 1-2-2   \nFive-A-Side – 5 players    \n    Allowed formations: 2-1-1, 1-2-1, 1-1-2   \nThese can all be created in different fashions, but all require at least one player in each position, goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and attacker.   \n3 Stars   \nChoose only 3 players.  You can use all 3 players from one team. Allowed formation is 1 defender, 1 midfielder and 1 forward.   \n\n#### Special rules for postponements of football matches in daily fantasy    \n**Pre-start of tournaments**   \nIf a game is cancelled within 45 mins of tournament start, then the tournament will be cancelled.   \nIf a game is cancelled more than 45 mins before tournament start, then the game will be removed and tournament goes ahead.\nAny players remaining in lineups from cancelled games will receive 0 points.   \nIf more than 25% of games are cancelled then the tournament will be cancelled, this supersedes above two rules.\n\n**Once tournament begins**   \nIf 25% or less of games are cancelled then tournament goes ahead. Players chosen for the cancelled game will receive their xFP (expected fantasy points). This is calculated by a player’s price in the tournament, divided by a factor of 2.    \nE.g. if Salah’s price is 12M, he will receive 6 points.\nIf more than 25% of games are cancelled then tournament will be cancelled.   \n\n#### Transfers of Fantasy Football    \nFor multiple-gameweek tournaments (tournaments spanning over more than one gameweek) there can be transfers allowed. The number of free transfers may vary but in standard tournaments, the number is limited to one transfer per gameweek. Further transfer above the tournament limit will result in the manager having 4 points deducted per transfer. Note that when creating private tournaments or challenges it is possible to choose the number of free transfers.\n\n#### Point system of Fantasy Football   \nPlayers receive points continuously through live feeds from the stat provider Sportyman, during and up until right after each match. The points are given based on the player’s performance on the field, which can generate both positive and negative value.\n\nSportyman will verify all stats directly after the match to ensure the best quality possible before finalizing the points. Their result is official and will only be changed if there are obviously wrong scoring.\n\n#### Stacking penalty   \nThere is an important rule in place for daily fantasy tournaments: If you pick more than one defensive player (including keeper) from a club, the points awarded for clean sheet will decrease by 1 point for each additional defensive player from the same club. The stacking penalty has a maximum of minus 3 points.\n\nPlease note that this feature will not be used in the season game. Look for the stacking penalty icon below the tournament name in the tournament lobby, to see which tournaments that have this rule. For more information on the stacking penalty rule, please check out the separate article called “Stacking Penalty”.   \n\n\n\n#### Safety net  \nIf a player does not start his match, he will be replaced by an automatic sub if possible. The system will look for a replacement player that\n1) is from the same club as the original player\n2) plays in the same position as the original player\n3) costs the same or less as the original player\n\nAll three conditions need to be met. Then the system will pick the player with the highest price and put him in place of the original player. (If there are no replacement players that meet all three conditions, the user will not get any replacement players and the original player will stand). There is no limit on how many replacement players a team can receive.\n\nTiebreaker Rules when two or more replacement players cost the same.   \n1. Safety Net will pick the player with the most ‘FORM’ points. ‘FORM’ is based on a player's points average from his/her last 5 games.    \n2. If the players have the same ‘FORM’ points, then Safety Net will pick the player with the most fantasy ‘POINTS’ for the whole season.   \n3. If the players share the same seasonal ‘POINTS', Safety Net will pick the player by alphabetical order.   \n\nIf a player does not start the match, but comes into play at a later point in time, he will still be replaced. However, if a player starts the match, but get subbed out at some point, he will not be replaced.\n\n#### Extra Time / Penalty Shootout   \nAll matches are concluded in regular time (which includes injury time). Events that happens in extra time, or during a penalty shootout, will not be included.\n\n#### Captain and vice captain   \nYou will be asked to choose one of your players as captain in most fantasy football tournaments. Often you need to name a vice captain too. Accumulated player points will be doubled for captains. If the designated captain does not play at all, the points of the vice captain will be doubled.\n\n#### Shots on target, impact, assists   \nFrom June 11th 2021, we will make certain changes to football scoring rules.\n- Shot on target will now be counted (0.4p for mid/forwards, 0.6p for defenders).   \n- Points given for team winning/losing while player is on the pitch, reduced to +/-0.3p.   \n\nDEFINITION OF SHOT ON TARGET: A player is deemed to have a Shot on Target when making a clear attempt to score that:   \n- would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper, or   \n- is stopped by a player who is the last-man with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal (last line block)   \n\nShot on Target resulting in a direct goal will not be counted as SOT. Update as of 4th of August 2022: A SOT that results in a FA will give a SOT for the assisting player.         \nAlso, worth noting: Hitting the post or cross bar is not deemed a Shot on Target. The frame of the goal is not considered a target.   \n\n#### NOTE: About goals, assists and clearance vs deflection   \nGoals, own goals and regular assists: We will follow official decisions from the league as to who scored/assisted, unless we are 100% sure the decision is wrong. (Example: Player was named as scorer, but was nowhere near the ball).   \n\nSometimes official decisions change after the match is finished. For us to be able to pay out winnings from a tournament within a reasonable time, changes made to the official result 20 minutes or more after the match is finished, will not be taken into account.   \n\nFantasy assists: In situations where a player scores a goal, and he receives the ball from another player on his team - but an opponent touches the ball between the two - we will use our own definition, which differentiate between a clearance and a deflection.   \n\nIf the opponent performs a clearance (a controlled action), but the ball ends up at the goalscorer, a fantasy assist will not be given. (As long as it is a controlled action, it does not matter if it is a successful one).   \n\nIf the ball is deflected off the opponent (the ball hits him), and the ball ends up at the goalscorer, a fantasy assist will be given.   \n\nPlease note that an exception to this rule is made for keepers. For them, it does not matter whether it is a clearance or a deflection. We will give a fantasy assist, as long as the keeper is inside the penalty box when he makes the touch. If the keeper holds the ball before the goalscorer picks it up, a fantasy assist will not be given of course.   \n\nNote that no fantasy assist will be given if the goalscorer loses possession of the ball, but regains it, and scores. \n\nOther situations where a fantasy assist will be given:   \n- A player is fouled and a penalty is awarded, which results in a goal.   \n- A player is fouled and a freekick is awarded, which results in a goal (through a direct shot). \n- A player shoots and hits the crossbar or the post and the return ball is converted into a goal by another player.   \n\n#### Points table   \n\n   |Action| Points | \n   |: ------------|-------------- |\n   | Player plays at least 1 second  | 1 point  |\n   | Player plays at least 60 minutes  | 1 point |\n   | Midfielder or attacker plays the full match (started and not subbed) 1) | 1 point |\n   | Goalkeeper makes a save   | 0.5 point |\n   | Goalkeeper or defender keeps a clean sheet 5) | 4 points |\n   | Midfielder keeps a clean sheet 5) | 1 point |\n   | Goalkeeper scores a goal  | 8 points  |\n   | Defender scores a goal  | 6 points |\n   | Midfielder scores a goal | 5 points |\n   | Attacker scores a goal  | 4 points |\n   | Assist or Fantasy Assist    | 3 points |\n   | Own goal   | -2 points  |\n   | Cause a penalty kick | -2 points |\n   | Cause a freekick that leads to a direct shot goal  | -2 points  |\n   | Penalty miss 4)  | -2 points |\n   | Keeper saves a penalty kick 2) | 5 points |\n   | Yellow Card 6)  | -1 point |\n   | Red card 6) | -3 points |\n   | Shot on target by midfielder/forward | 0.4 points |\n   | Shot on target by defender | 0.6 points |\n   | Shot on target by keeper | 1.0 point  |\n   | Player’s team wins the period he is on the pitch 3)   | 0.3 points  |\n   | Player’s team loses the period he is on the pitch 3) | -0.3 points |\n   | Keeper or defender concedes 2 goals | -1 point |\n\n1) In order to get points for playing a full match, the player has to play 90 minutes plus injury time.\n\n2) Penalty save by keeper means he actually saves the penalty. If the opponent misses the target, hits the post or crossbar without the keeper touching the ball it is not classified as a penalty save.\n\n3) Starting from the time your player goes on the pitch and ending when he leaves the pitch; the result in this period decides if he has “won”, “lost” or “drawn”. \n\n4) A penalty miss is any penalty that does not result in the direct goal from the penalty spot (from July 2018). \n\n5) For a player to get points for clean sheet, he needs to play at least 60 minutes (and not concede a goal while he is on the pitch). Please note that if a player is subbed out in the 60th minute of a match, for example at 59:30, he did not play 60 minutes, and will not be given points for clean sheet, even though reports from the match will likely read subbed 60'. (This is logical, because if something happens 30 seconds after a match starts, this will clearly be something that happened in 1'.)  \n\n6) We will award points for yellow/red cards to players regardless of they being on the pitch or on the bench when the incident happens, because they can impact the match result. If such an event happens after ordinary time + injury time has ended, points will not be awarded, because the incident cannot impact the match result. If the referee blows his whistle, signaling it is over, no more points for cards will be given.",
        "some_answer_soccer_1": "There are two main types of fantasy sport competitions: Season game and daily fantasy sport.\n\n#### The season game: Excitement and fun every week!   \nSeason games for for Premier League are generally very popular. Like the name implies; these games run through all of the 38 rounds (also known as ‘gameweeks’) of PL. You pick 15 players, of which 11 will be chosen to play in any given gameweek. The remaining 4 are substitutes and will only play if players in the starting eleven do not get any playing time at all in that gameweek.\n\nIt is possible to buy new players to the squad during the season. You can buy any player, as long as you have enough funds (there is a virtual budget), and that his position is available. In other words, you always have to sell a player in order to buy a new one. Note that usually you can not have more than 3 players from the same team in the season game. Once the season game has started, the number of buys you make should be very few. Around 1 per gameweek on average is recommended. There are two wildcards in the season game that you can use when you want to make wholesale changes to your team.\n\nThe season games offer the feeling of being a real manager, constantly looking for improvements to your squad, and getting the maximum out of the players you already have. Planning a few gameweeks ahead is an advantage in these games. While you can win prizes for being the best manager of the month or the gameweek, the main focus in the season games is the standings at the end of the season. In our season game there are no less than 1,250 real money prizes based on these standings.\n\n#### Daily fantasy: Buy-in today, get your prizes in the evening!   \nDaily fantasy competitions typically run for only 1 gameweek. You can enter a competition, create your dream team, and watch how well your favorites perform – all through a couple of days. There are even daily fantasy competitions that run for only 1 match.\n\nCompared to the season game, in daily fantasy you don’t care about what may happen to a player in a couple of weeks. Your focus is always the next match, and only that.\n\nAfter the matches in a daily fantasy competition have started, there is no buying and selling of players (unless the tournament have a feature called ‘Late swap’). This means that daily fantasy generally require less ‘maintenance’ from the user than the season game. It is possible to join a big number of tournaments that are running more or less at the same time, and you can have several different teams in each tournament. Once you have entered all your teams, you can just sit back and enjoy – the job is done!\n\nOne big advantage with daily fantasy is that you always start out with a clean slate. Did you do badly last weekend? No problem, everybody starts from scratch this weekend! Many people like the fact that it is a short-lasting game. Buy-in on Saturday and get your prizes by Sunday night!\n\nWhile the PL season game is very big on Fanteam, more than 99% of the fantasy tournaments available on Fanteam during the year are daily fantasy.",
        "some_answer_soccer_2": "NOTE: This is an article about safety net for football. There are other sports that have a safety net feature as well, and it does not necessarily work in exactly the same way as for football. To learn more about those other safety nets, we urge you to check the rules for the specific sport you are looking for.  \n\n### Safety net for football    \n\nBecause daily fantasy football does not have subs, you can get unlucky and find yourself having less than 11 players if one of your guys are not in the starting lineup. To help avoid such unfortunate cases, the Safety Net tries to find a replacement player for you.\n\n#### How it works   \nIf a player does not start his match, he will be replaced by an automatic sub if possible. The system will look for a replacement player who  \n1) is from the same club as the original player  \n2) plays in the same position as the original player  \n3) costs the same or less as the original player  \n\nAll three conditions need to be met. Then the system will pick the player with the highest price and put him in place of the original player. This can happen even after the match has started. If a possible replacement is subbed in, he will be preferred to the original player as long as the latter has not entered the match at that time. We will not reverse such a replacement, even if the original player enters the game.\n\nIf there are no replacement players that meet all three conditions, the user will not get any replacement players and the original player will stand. There is no limit on how many replacement players a team can receive.\n\nTiebreaker Rules when two or more replacement players cost the same.   \n1. Safety Net will pick the player with the most ‘FORM’ points. ‘FORM’ is based on a player's points average from his/her last 5 games.   \n2. If the players have the same ‘FORM’ points, then Safety Net will pick the player with the most fantasy ‘POINTS’ for the whole season.   \n3. If the players share the same seasonal ‘POINTS', Safety Net will pick the player by alphabetical order.   \n\nIf a player does not start the match, but comes into play at a later point in time, he will still be replaced. However, if a player starts the match, but get subbed out at some point, he will not be replaced.\n\nWhat happens if your captain does not start and gets subbed out?\nIf you have a vice captain, the vice captain will get the doubling of points.\nIf you don’t have a vice captain, there will be no doubling of points.",

Look for the stacking penalty icon below the tournament name in the tournament lobby, to see which tournaments that have this rule.\n\n1st defensive player: 0 points   \n2nd defensive player: -1 points   \n3rd defensive player: -2 points   \n4th-6th defensive player: -3 points    \n\nIt is actually quite easy; if you have three defensive players from the same club, one will have no stacking penalty (he gets 4 points for clean sheet), one will get minus 1 (so he gets 3 points for a clean sheet), and one will get minus 2 (he gets 2 points for a clean sheet).\n\nOnly defensive players that actually gets a clean sheet will count towards the stacking penalty. Let’s say that you have three defensive players from the same club on your team, and two of them are subbed while team is leading 1-0, before the other team makes it 1-1. Now only two players can get a stacking penalty, so one will get -1 and one will get 0.\n\nThere is no stacking penalty for midfielders.\n\n#### How do I know which player gets the biggest (or smallest) stacking penalty?\nWe rank the players that are on your team. When ranking defensive players from the same club, the priority is:\nCaptain > Vice Captain > Price > Last name.   \nFor price, the higher price will rank highest. For last name, early position in the alphabet will rank highest.   \nSo, if you have a defensive player as captain he will never get a stacking penalty. If you don’t have a defensive player from this club as captain, but instead as vice captain, he will not get a stacking penalty. If there is no captain or vice captain in defense, the highest priced player will be 1st defensive player, and won’t get a stacking penalty.\n\n#### Why do you have this rule?   \nWe want the focus of the managers to be on single players, not on whole defenses. This is more aligned with the original idea of fantasy football, and similar to what is the focus in the season game. With this new rule a manager can have 6 defensive players from 6 different teams, and still have a chance of winning! Now you can have Van Aanholt, Doherty, Rose, Robertson, and Alonso on the same team! Note that it is not prohibited to play 3+3, but it will not be as profitable as it was previously.\n\nAdditionally, the rule will make it easier for users to find unique team combinations, so there will be less frequent splitting of prizes. This is good for everybody!",
        "some_answer_soccer_4": "In the new version of this format, we handicap the players according to how good performance we expect from them. Instead of picking players by price, you can pick them by bonus points. If you decide to, you can choose players with low expectation, and therefore high bonus points, and start the tournament in the lead! Or you can choose players with high expectation, and low bonus points, so you will be in pursuit of the other teams!\n\nPursuit was originally developed for football, but is now used in some other sports as well. Pursuit can be used for multi-match tournaments, but really shines in tournaments with fewer matches.   \n\n#### Key features    \n- Each player on your team gets bonus points, based on their expected performance (getting playing points).  \n- Players who are expected to perform worse than the average in the tournament will get positive bonus points.\n- Players who are expected to perform better than the average will get negative bonus points.\n- Your captain receives double playing points, and double bonus points as well!\n- Your vice captain receives 1.5 x playing points, and 1.5 x bonus points as well!\n- There is no budget.  \n- Bonus points are awarded at the start of the tournament and do not change.\n\nIf two or more entries end up with the same points total, the tie-breaker is the points accumulated by the user’s team during the game (including captains’ bonuses). The higher these points are, the higher you will rank when there is otherwise a tie. In other words, the lower your pursuit bonus is, the higher you will rank when there is a tie.",
        "some_answer_soccer_5": "#### What are satellites?   \nCheap qualifiers, so users can get into more expensive tournaments even if the buy-ins are above their comfort level.  \n\n#### Which tournaments have satellites?   \nGreat candidates are big tournaments like SCOFF and WCOFF. It can be used for tournaments with medium buy-ins as well, like the €20 Weekly Monster.\n\n#### What does these abbreviations mean?   \nWCOFF: World Championship Of Fantasy Football.   \nSCOFF: Spring Championship Of Fantasy Football.   \nWCOFB: World Championship OF Fantasy Basket.   \nThese are tournaments with big buy-ins and big guarantees that usually goes over 2 gameweeks.   \n\n#### What types of satellites exists?   \nWe have two types:  \n- Direct satellite. Win a ticket in this one and you are all set for the target tournament.  \n- Steps. Play step 1, win ticket to step 2, and win ticket to the target tournament.  \n\nIn other words you can compete for a prize pool of 500k with as little as €2.75.   \n\n#### What about ties?   \nIn a pursuit satellite, if two or more entrants get the same amount of points, the team who have the highest amount of player points (including the captain’s bonus) will rank higher. In a traditional daily fantasy format, if two or more entrants get the same amount of points, the team who has spent the least amount of money will rank higher. If entrants are still tied, the places will be split. If there is not enough ticket prizes for those tied, cash may be used as payment.",
        "some_answer_soccer_6": "It is the world's largest Premier League seasonal fantasy cash game! With a record-breaking prize pool guarantee of €1,000,000, the Premier League season game 2020/21 is here! Manage your dream team throughout the season, as you try to manouver to the top and the first prize of €200,000. You can even win more than that, as it is allowed to have several entries. The buy-in for each team is €25. It gives you 38 gameweek's of excitement, joy and some frustration. Join today! Gameweek 1 starts September 12th, and you must register before 12:00 CET for your players to accumulate points in that round.\n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nThis year, we have changed the deadline for team changes to 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or change your starting XI after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Friday night, for example. Please note that while there is late reg for this tournament (see below), you MUST register before the 90 minute window in order to compete in that gameweek.\n\n#### Transfers   \nFor season-long Premier league tournament there’s one free transfer allowed between each gameweek. If you don't use your free transfer one week, you can do two free transfers the following week. It is not possible to save more than 1 transfer, and the maximum amount of free transfers is therefore 2. Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each.\nBefore gameweek 1 starts there is no limit on the number of free transfers.\n\n#### Price changes   \nPlayer prices can change when the season is ongoing. The price changes are based on how popular (in terms of transfers) a certain player is in the season game and can also be influenced by the form of the player. Maximum change (up or down) for a player is 0.1M per day, and 0.3M between gameweeks.\nThe price you see for a specific player is what it costs to buy him, and it is the amount you will receive when you sell him. There is no tax when you sell players, so the actual prize of the player when you sell him is the amount you will receive.\n\n#### Wildcards   \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers throughout a gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.   \nThere are two wildcards available to you in the season-long Premier league tournament, one that can be activated until the start of gameweek 19, and one that can be activated after the start of gameweek 19, but before the start of gameweek 38.\nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcard does not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \n\n#### Substitutes   \nYou have to select four substitutes: Three outfield players and one goalkeeper. Please note, that these are ordered in priority from left to right, meaning your primary substitute is the one on the farthest left.   \nIf one or more players among your starters did not play in the match at all, the system will automatically substitute the non-playing player with the 1st available substitute. If your first substitute did not play, the system will move on to the next substitute and see if he played.\nImportant! The system will not put in a sub if it results in an illegal formation. It is always required to have at least three defenders, one midfielder and one forward.\n\n#### Numbers of players from a club   \nYour team in the season game cannot include more than 3 players from the same club.\n\n#### Late registration: Until start of gameweek 5   \nIt will be possible to join the 1 Million game after the season starts, as long as gameweek 5 has not started yet. A late registrant will get compensation points for the rounds he missed: 70% of the average score in the missed rounds.\n\n#### Satellites   \nThe buy-in for the PL season game is €25. However, it is possible to qualify through cheap satellites, running in many different leagues and sports. Entries to the season game won through satellites can not be exchanged for cash or sold, they have to be used by the same user who played the satellite.\n\n#### Total prizes: Minimum €1,000,000!   \nThe guarantee for the season game 2020/21 is a record-breaking €1,000,000! Please note that the guarantee means that €1,000,000 will be paid out regardless of the number of entries. This is how all guarantees work on Fanteam.\nThe majority of the money (€931,500) will be paid out according to the standings at the end of the season, as follows.   \n\n| Position     | Prize level  |  Places    | Total  |\n| :----------- | :----------: | :--------: |-------:|\n|  1st         | €200000      | 1          | €200000| \n|  2nd         | €100000      | 1          | €100000| \n|  3rd         | €60000      | 1          | €60000| \n|  4th         | €40000      | 1          | €40000| \n|  5th         | €25000      | 1          | €25000| \n|  6th         | €20000      | 1          | €20000| \n|  7th         | €15000      | 1          | €15000| \n|  8th         | €12000      | 1          | €12000| \n|  9th         | €10000      | 1          | €10000| \n|  10th         | €8000      | 1          | €8000| \n|  11th         | €7000      | 1          | €7000| \n|  12th         | €6000      | 1          | €6000| \n|  13th         | €5000      | 1          | €5000| \n|  14th         | €4000      | 1          | €4000| \n|  15th         | €3500      | 1          | €3500| \n|  16-18         | €3000      | 3          | €9000| \n|  19-23         | €2500      | 5          | €12500| \n|  24-28         | €2000      | 5          | €10000| \n|  29-33         | €1500      | 5          | €7500| \n|  34-41         | €1250      | 8          | €10000| \n|  42-51         | €1000      | 10         | €10000| \n|  52-61         | €800      | 10          | €8000| \n|  62-71         | €650      | 10          | €6500| \n|  72-84         | €500      | 13          | €6500| \n|  85-99         | €450      | 15          | €6750| \n|  100-129       | €400      | 30          | €12000| \n|  130-159         | €350      | 30          | €10500| \n|  160-189         | €300      | 30          | €9000| \n|  190-229         | €275      | 40          | €11000| \n|  230-269         | €250      | 40          | €10000| \n|  270-309         | €200      | 40          | €8000| \n|  310-349         | €175      | 40          | €7000| \n|  350-399         | €150      | 50          | €7500| \n|  400-449         | €125      | 50          | €6250| \n|  450-510         | €100      | 60          | €6000| \n|  520-599         | €90      | 80          | €7200| \n|  600-799         | €80      | 200          | €16000| \n|  800-1099         | €70      | 300          | €21000| \n|  1100-1399         | €65      | 300          | €19500| \n|  1400-1799         | €60      | 400          | €24000| \n|  1800-2199         | €55      | 400          | €22000| \n|  2200-2699         | €50      | 500          | €25000| \n|  2700-3199         | €45      | 500          | €22500| \n|  3200-3799         | €40      | 600          | €24000| \n|  3800-4499         | €35      | 700          | €24500| \n|  4500-5659         | €30      | 1170          | €35100| \n\n\n\n#### Manager of the Month   \nThe best managers for each month will get prizes too (a total of €14,400):\n\n|  Position         | Prize level      | Months          | Total|\n| :----------- | :----------: | :--------: |-------:| \n|  1st         | €1000      | 8          | €8000| \n|  2nd         | €500      | 8          | €4000| \n|  3rd         | €150      | 8          | €1200| \n|  4th         | €100      | 8          | €800| \n|  5th         | €50      | 8          | €400| \n\nManager of the month will be calculated on round basis, so points from a round starting (for example) 30th of September will count in September, even if the last matches of the round are played 2nd of October.

For each entry in the season game, you receive 4 tickets for these tournaments.

If the opponent misses the target, hits the post or crossbar without the keeper touching the ball it is not classified as a penalty save.\n\n4) Starting from the time your player goes on the pitch and ending when he leaves the pitch; the result in this period decides if he has “won”, “lost” or “drawn”. \n\n5) A penalty miss is any penalty that does not result in the direct goal from the penalty spot (from July 2018). \n\n6) For a player to get points for clean sheet, he needs to play at least 60 minutes (and not concede a goal while he is on the pitch).    \n\n7) We will award points for yellow/red cards to players regardless of they being on the pitch or on the bench when the incident happens, because they can impact the match result. If such an event happens after ordinary time + injury time has ended, points will not be awarded, because the incident cannot impact the match result. If the referee blows his whistle, signaling it is over, no more points for cards will be given.",
        "some_answer_soccer_7": "The 2021 edition of the SCOFF is here! Two daily fantasy football rounds combined into one great final with a huge guaranteed prize pool of €500,000!\n\nIt spans over 2 Premier League gameweeks. The first round is GW37 and the second is GW38. Each gameweek is a separate event, and the final standings will be calculated by adding your score from the first round to your score from the second round. You need to create a brand new team for each round, otherwise you will get 0 points for that round. If two or more participants have the same total score, they will split the prizes in question.   \n\n#### What is the first prize?\nIt is €100,000!\n\n#### But there will be nice prizes to a lot of places, right?\nExactly! We decided that the top 7 all will get €10,000 or more. In some cases MUCH MORE! In total there are 121 prizes, the lowest ones are €1,500. If there are more entries than the guarantee is based on, we will add/increase prizes correspondingly. If there are less entries, obviously the guarantee will stand. \n\n#### What is the buy-in?\nIt is €1,100. €1,000 goes towards the prize pool.\n\n#### But I can get in cheaper than that, right?\nOf course! We are running satellites all the time, priced moderately. Some cost only €2.75 to enter.\n\n#### When does it start?\nThe final starts with gameweek 37 of the Premier League, which is scheduled to take place in the middle of May.\n\n#### How is this tournament different from other big tournaments?\nWell, one key difference is the high buy-in. While it is hard to get into the final, that comes with a big reward. Suddenly, you are in a limited field (approximately 500), as opposed to the larger fields of the Weekly Monsters or 1 million season game. Once you are in the money in the final, you win at least €1,500! Having the final run over two gameweeks instead of one also adds to the entertainment value. Imagine how exciting the days in-between rounds would be if you were in the top 10 after gameweek 1?\n\n#### Is there a maximum number of entries one user can have?\nYes, it is 10. Please note: We will not pay money for tickets to the final that you cannot use yourself, and it is not allowed to sell tickets. So please do not try to win more than 10 tickets in the satellites.   \nIf you find yourself with step 2 tickets that you cannot use because you won them before you won 10 seats to the final, we will exchange those step 2 tickets with tickets to EURO 2020 of comparable value.   \n\n#### If someone has 10 tickets already, who will win the \"surplus\" ticket?\nIt will be the user who has the next entry in the standings, not already gotten a ticket for that entry. Example: If a user already have 9 tickets, and then wins more than 1 ticket, we will issue him the 10th ticket in the tournament that is first in the settlement order. This means that an extra ticket will open up in one or more of the satellites that are about to be settled. (We have a set order for which satellites will be settled first. For the Monster satellite, we will first settle the 55€ buy-in, then the €20 buy-in, and then the 2€ buy-in. Single match tournaments will be settled before the Monster satellite.)\n\n#### Special rule for identical teams in satellites   \nIn satellites to the SCOFF final which pays out only 1 seat, we will no longer pay out money to a participant who has entered two identical teams in an effort to get cash instead of a ticket. Instead we will give the participant a ticket to the final. If the participant already have the maximum number of tickets to the final, he will win nothing from the satellite.

In such tournaments, you have to pick exactly one player from each match on the schedule.   \n\nThis game makes it easier to see who is actually leading the tournament.

        "some_answer_soccer_9": "It is that time of the year again! WCOFF is here! Two daily fantasy football rounds combined into one great final with a huge guaranteed prize pool of €500,000!  \n\nIt spans over 2 Premier League gameweeks. The first round is GW24 and the second is GW25. Each gameweek is a separate event, and the final standings will be calculated by adding your score from the first round to your score from the second round. If two or more participants have the same total score, they will split the prizes in question. You need to draft your team for Round 1, and after it ends you will see a new event in your dashboard, where you can draft your team for Round 2.   \n\nBoth events are standard, 11-player Daily Fantasy events, same type of tournament as our Weekly Monsters, which means both Stacking Penalty and Safety Net applies. You can freely make any changes to your teams before the deadlines for the two rounds. The deadlines are set to the start of the first match of each round. You need to pick a captain and a vice captain, where the captain will get double points and the vice captain will get double points if the captain is replaced by safety net or simply does not play at all.  \n\n**When is the final?**   \nIt starts on February 8th (was postponed from December 26th). The second part of it will commence on February 12th.\n\n**What is the buy-in of the final?**   \nIt is €1,000.    \n\n**Can I qualify through cheaper satellites?**   \nYes! We will have lots of satellites every week leading up to the end of December. Buy-in levels will vary: €2, €11, €55 will be used a lot.\n\n**What is the first prize?**    \nThe winner will get €100,000. What would YOU want to use that kind of money for?\n\n**But there will be nice prizes to a lot of places, right?**   \nExactly! We decided that the top 10 all will get €7,100 or more. In some cases MUCH MORE! In total there are 121 prizes, the smallest ones are €1,500. If there are more entries than the guarantee is based on, we will add/increase prizes correspondingly. If there are less entries, obviously the guarantee will stand.   \n\n**Is there a maximum number of entries I can have in the final?**   \nYes, it is 12. Please note: We will not pay money for tickets to the final that you cannot use yourself, and it is not allowed to sell tickets. So please do not try to win more than 12 tickets in the satellites.   \n\nTotal prizes: Minimum €500,000!   \n\n| Position     | Prize level  |  Places    | Total  |\n| :----------- | :----------: | :--------: |-------:|\n|  1st         | €100000      |  1         | €100000| \n|  2nd         | €60000       |  1         | €60000| \n|  3rd         | €35000       |  1         | €35000| \n|  4th         | €20000       |  1         | €20000| \n|  5th         | €15000       |  1         | €15000| \n|  6th         | €12000       |  1         |  €12000| \n|  7th         | €10000       |  1         |  €10000| \n|  8th         |  €8800       |  1         |  €8800| \n|  9th         |  €7800       |  1         |  €7800| \n|  10th        |  €7100       |  1         |  €7100| \n|  11th        |  €6500       |  1         |  €6500| \n|  12th        |  €6000       |  1         |  €6000| \n|  13th        |  €5500       |  1         |  €5500| \n|  14th        |  €5000       |  1         |  €5000| \n|  15th        |  €4500       |  1         |  €4500| \n|  16th        |  €4100       |  1         |  €4100| \n|  17th        |  €3700       |  1         |  €3700| \n|  18th        |  €3400       |  1         |  €3400| \n|  19th        |  €3100       |  1         |  €3100| \n|  20th        |  €2900       |  1         |  €2900| \n|  21-22       |  €2700       |  2         |  €5400| \n|  23-24       |  €2600       |  2         |  €5200| \n|  25-26       |  €2500       |  2         |  €5000| \n|  27-28       |  €2400       |  2         |  €4800| \n|  29-31       |  €2300       |  3         |  €6900| \n|  32-34       |  €2200       |  3         |  €6600| \n|  35-39       |  €2100       |  5         |  €10500| \n|  40-44       |  €2000       |  5         |  €10000| \n|  45-49       |  €1900       |  5         |  €9500| \n|  50-54       |  €1800       |  5         |  €9000| \n|  55-59       |  €1750       |  5         |  €8750| \n|  60-69       |  €1700       |  10         | €17000| \n|  70-79       |  €1650       | 10         | €16500|\n|  80-89       |  €1600       | 10         | €16000|\n|  90-98       |  €1550       | 9         | €13950|\n|  99-121      |  €1500       | 22         | €33000|",

        "some_answer_fantasy_0": "It is a type of online game where participants create a dream team, picking players or athletes from a real-world sport. The players/athletes are awarded fantasy points, based on their performance in the real world. The goal for your team is to get as many fantasy points as possible, so the challenge is to find the players/athletes that have the biggest fantasy points scoring potential.  \n   \nUsually there is a budget, setting a limit to how expensive players/athletes the participants can have on his team. Generally, the better a player/athlete is, the more expensive he/she will be. For each fantasy sport there is a set of scoring rules, which determine the amount of points given for a specific type of event. For example in football, it is common to give 4 points for a goal scored if the player is a forward, 5 points if he is a midfielder, and 6 points if he is a defender.\n\nFantasy sports work especially well for team sports, like football, hockey and basketball. Typically, the participant picks one or two players from several different teams, and ends up with a collection of players that you would imagine could do better than any real-world team.\n\nFantasy sport can be played with or without real money prizes and buy-ins. For those following certain sports, having a fantasy game on the side adds a dimension to the experience and makes it even more exciting.\n\nThere are two main types of fantasy sport competitions: Season game and daily fantasy sport. The majority of our games are daily fantasy, but we also have huge season games!",
        "some_answer_fantasy_1": "#### The Universal 6 Format\nWe are introducing a new format for fantasy tournaments, designed to be possible to use in all sports, easily recognizable for the user when he moves from one sport to another. It is especially useful for when you have a small number of matches.   \n\n- Classic fantasy with a budget.\n- 6 players, pick from any position.\n- The captain will receive 1.50 x his points, but also he will cost 1.50 x the price.\n- The vice captain will receive 1.20 x his points, but also he will cost 1.20 x the price.   \n\nPlease note that in this format, if the captain does not play, it is the replacement who gets the 1.5x points. Similarly, if the vice captain does not play, it is his replacement who will get the 1.2x points. In other words, if there is no possible replacement for your captain (or vice captain), and if he does not play at all, you will have no captain! It is definitely a situation to avoid! \n\n#### Tie-breaker rule\nIn daily fantasy when there is more than one entry with the same amount of points, the general daily fantasy tie-breaker rule will apply: The entry with the lowest budget used will be ranked the highest. The exception is Pursuit, where the tie-breaker is the player points (including captain’s bonus). The highest amount of player points will rank highest. If the entries can not be separated in this way, the prize will be split. If it is a satellite, money will be paid out instead of a ticket.\n\nIn traditional season games, there is no tie breaker for this purpose. Entries that have the same amount of points will split the prize.\n\n#### Wildcards and saved-up transfers in season games   \nIn tournaments that last for more than one gameweek, there may be one or more wildcards. One of these enables the user to make an unlimited number of transfers without getting a penalty, in a gameweek of the user's choosing. Worth noting is that when you use a wildcard, you zero out your saved-up transfers. So in the following gameweek you will be back to whatever is the initial amount of free transfers, usually 1.    \n\n#### Adding players to the tournament pool\nThe players available for selection in a tournament are always subject to change. We will always do our utmost to include all players who are likely to take part in a match when creating a tournament, but sometimes we need to add players at a later time. This will typically happen when official line-ups are announced, which for football usually happens around one hour (or sometimes less) before the start of the game. However, changes to the player pool can be made at any time before the official line-ups are announced. It is rare that such changes cause big problems, but we recommend that you always check the official line-ups if you can.\n\n#### Rescheduled, postponed and abandoned matches\nIf a match gets postponed/cancelled, the tournament may be cancelled, in which case all users will receive a full refund. However, if the match is rescheduled to be played within 48 hours of the tournament time frame, then the game can still be included in the tournament at our discretion.   \n\nThis rule overrides all sport-specific rules on the subject, except for football, tennis, baseball, eFootball, basket and MMA.   \n\nIf a match is abandoned during the match (bad weather, power failure, spectator riot, etc), all players will keep the points they gained up until that point in the game. If the match is resumed within 48 hours of the time frame of the tournament, points gained after the resumption will be added to the total. If the match is resumed at a later time, only the points achieved before the abandonment will count.\n   \n#### Cancelling an entry   \nIt is not possible to cancel an entry to a tournament once you have entered. Please check that you are entering the right tournament when the system asks you “Are you sure?”.\n\n#### Payouts\nTournaments will generally pay approx 20% of the field. However, if a tournament has less than 37 users, paid places and prize distribution are calculated according to the following table:\n\n![Payouts few entries](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg-stg.net/support-pages/payouts-fantasy-few-entries.jpg){.right .ml-s .m-s}   \nPlease note that tournaments with only 1 entry will have no payout, even those with a guarantee. In such cases, the user will get a full refund for his entry.   \n      \n#### Bubble protection for early entries   \nIf you finish just outside of the money, you can still win a prize if the tournament has bubble protection! Look for the icon in the lobby!   \nIn order to qualify for such prizes, your team must be entered at least 12 hours before the tournament starts. The bubble prize is typically a ticket to another tournament.   \nThe bubble protection zone covers a number of places equal to 5% of the number of prizes in the tournament. So, if the number of prizes is 100, you need to end up in 101st to 105th place to be a bubble boy (or bubble girl).   \nNote that if only some of your teams were entered early, only the early ones will be able to compete for a bubble ticket. Editing a team that was entered early is of course allowed; the eligibility of the team is not changed. If an entry in the bubble protection zone did not enter early, the spot will not be transferred to the next on the list.   \n\n#### Changes in events data\nWe receive event data from stats providers. After every match has finished, we receive final data and confirm the tournaments for payouts. For some sports this will take longer time. An example is Ice Hockey, where we need to wait for the final match protocol.\n\nOn rare occasions, leagues revise the events even after they have been considered final. In case that happens, our player events will not be changed, and the payouts are not revised. However, when data needs to be corrected because of obvious errors or there are problems with payouts, we will aim to find a fair solution, and in many cases re-calculate pay-outs.\n\n#### Termination of a tournament\nIn the case a fantasy tournament or other game is terminated prematurely or cancelled due to any reason, the players will be fully refunded within 3 working days from the cancellation time.\n\nA serious malfunction that leads to cancellation of a fantasy tournament or other game voids all pays and play. If there are minor incidents that do not cause big disruptions of the game, the tournament/game will proceed as normal. The determination on whether it is a serious malfunction or not is at our discretion.",
        "some_answer_fantasy_2": "There are two main types of fantasy sport competitions: Season games and daily fantasy sport.\n\n#### Season games\nExcitement and fun every week!\nSeason games are generally very popular. Like the name implies; these games run through all of the rounds (gameweeks) of a league. In Premier League, you pick 15 players, of which 11 will be chosen to play in any given gameweek. The remaining 4 are substitutes and will only play if players in the starting eleven do not get any playing time at all in that gameweek.\n\nIt is possible to buy new players to the squad during the season. You can buy any player, as long as you have enough funds (there is a virtual budget), and that his position is available. In other words, you always have to sell a player in order to buy a new one. Note that usually you can not have more than 3 players from the same team in the season game. Once the season game has started, the number of buys you make should be very few. Around 1 per gameweek on average is recommended. There are two wildcards in the season game that you can use when you want to make wholesale changes to your team.\n\nThe season games offer the feeling of being a real manager, constantly looking for improvements to your squad, and getting the maximum out of the players you already have. Planning a few gameweeks ahead is an advantage in these games. While you can win prizes for being the best manager of the month or the gameweek, the main focus in the season games is the standings at the end of the season. In our season game there are no less than 1,250 real money prizes based on these standings.\n\n#### Daily fantasy games\nBuy-in today, get your prizes tomorrow! Daily fantasy competitions typically run for only 1 gameweek. You can enter a competition, create your dream team, and watch how well your favorites perform – all through a couple of days. There are even daily fantasy competitions that run for only 1 match.\n\nCompared to the season game, in daily fantasy you don’t care about what may happen to a player in a couple of weeks. Your focus is always the next match, and only that.\n\nAfter the matches in a daily fantasy competition have started, there is no buying and selling of players (unless the tournament have a feature called ‘Late swap’). This means that daily fantasy generally require less ‘maintenance’ from the user than the season game. It is possible to join a big number of tournaments that are running more or less at the same time, and you can have several different teams in each tournament. Once you have entered all your teams, you can just sit back and enjoy – the job is done!\n\nOne big advantage with daily fantasy is that you always start out with a clean slate. Did you do badly last weekend? No problem, everybody starts from scratch this weekend! Many people like the fact that it is a short-lasting game. Buy-in on Saturday and get your prizes by Sunday night!\n\nWhile the PL season game is very big for us, more than 99% of our fantasy tournaments during the year are daily fantasy.",
        "some_answer_fantasy_3": "For the first time, we are happy to announce a season game for NBA! Promising to be an intense experience with a new gameweek every day, the NBA season game has a €25,000 guarantee! Manage your dream team throughout the whole NBA regular season, as you try to maneuver to the top of the standings! The buy-in is €25 and it is possible to have up to 5 entries. Join today! The first match starts December 23rd at 01:00 CET while the deadline for entries (and changes) is 22nd at 23:30 CET.    \n\n#### Prizes\nWe guarantee the prize pool to be at least €25,000. If we reach the number required to fill the guarantee, each additional entry will contribute to the prize pool, which will then go above €25,000. To find out specifically what the first prize will be, please look in the prize section of the in-game rules. If we go above €25,000, the first prize will increase as well.    \n\n#### Format  \nYou will have 9 players at any time: 2 point guards, 2 shooting guards, 2 shooting forwards, 2 point forwards, 1 center. No captains. Maximum 2 players from any club. The tournament will run for the whole regular season (although matches for the second half of it may not be scheduled until later).    \n\n#### Number of free transfers\nParticipants will receive one transfer per every 2 gameweeks, and it is possible to save up, so you have a maximum of 2 transfers for a gameweek. It is however not possible to make any additional transfers in exchange for a point penalty. Usually, a gameweek lasts a day.    \n\n#### Wildcards\nThere are no wildcards in the default setup. However, if the season experiences big disruption with many teams inactive due to Covid-19, we may open up for wildcard(s).    \n\n#### Postponed/abandoned matches\nWe assume that any postponed match will be played at some point during the season. Such matches will simply be put into a future gameweek that corresponds with the new starting date. If a match is abandoned mid-game, and not completed at a later date, the players will keep the points they accumulated up to the point of the interruption. If an interrupted match is re-scheduled to be finished at a later date, the players will keep accumulating points as normal. It is the team line-up for the original gameweek that will be used for this.\n\n#### Player prices will be adjusted\nThere will be adjustments of player prices during the game. Price changes will happen at 12:00 CET on the first Thursday of the month. Maximum 1M change per player. Price changes will be based on expected performance in the upcoming 30 days. There is no sales tax.\n\n#### Deadline for changes to your team\nChanges can be made all the way up to 90 minutes before the start of the first match of the gameweek.    \n\n#### Substitutes\nThe format has no subs, and safety net will not be in use.    \n\n#### Late registration: Until Sunday 27th of December, at 20:00 CET\nIt will be possible to enter even after the tournament has started. The final deadline is Sunday 27th, which is the start of gameweek 3. Please note that while generally this tournament assigns one gameweek to each day, the setup in the beginning of the tournament is slightly different (to help late reg work in a nice way). When late regging, you will be compensated for the gameweeks you did not have a team in. You will get 80% of the average score in the missing gameweeks.    \n\n#### Satellites\nThe entry in the NBA season game is €25, but it is possible to get in via cheaper satellites. Entries to the NBA season game cannot be exchanged for cash or sold, they have to be used to the user who won the tickets. Please note that you can only participate with 5 entries in the NBA season game though.   \n\n#### Standard scoring rules\nThe game will use standard basket scoring rules. If you are in doubt, please look them up, under \"Fantasy Basket Rules\".",
        "some_answer_fantasy_4": "All our tournaments have a guaranteed prize pool. Even if there are not enough entries to pay for the prize pool, the guarantee will stand, and we will pay out the promised amount.\nThe guaranteed amount is just a minimum (worst case) number. If there are more entries than is required to pay for the guarantee, the prize pool will simply get bigger than the guarantee and we will pay out even more!\n\n#### Example 1:\nIn a €20 buy-in tournament (where the rake is €2), the guarantee is €50,000. If there are 2,500 entries, we will get €5,000 in rake. But the prize pool is short, as €18 x 2,500 = €45,000. So the €5,000 in rake is paid back to the pool, as €5,000 is exactly what is missing for the prize pool to reach €50,000.\n\n#### Example 2:\nThe same tournament, but now there are 3,300 entries. We have €18 x 3,300 = €59,400, which is the new prize pool. At this point, the guarantee becomes irrelevant, as obviously we want the bigger prize pool for our players. Note that the rake per entry (in this case €2) will always remain the same, regardless of reaching the guarantee or not. Of course, we do not take extra money out of the prize pool just because we go over the guarantee!\n\n#### No cap on entries!\nWe have decided to abandon our general policy of having a max number of entries that a tournament can accept. As a consequence, we can now set guarantees a bit lower without having to fear that players will be shut out. As a reminder, there is no reason to stop entering teams once the guarantee has been reached. Once the guarantee has been paid for, the prize pool will grow for each new entry added! In some cases the prize pools will be bigger than before with the new setup.",

Replacement players will be:    \n• From the same team as the original player   \n• Play in the same position as the original player   \n• Cost the same or less as the original player   \n\nIf no players match the above conditions, the system will look for replacement players from other teams, who:   \n• Play in the same position as the original player   \n• Cost the same or less as the original player   \n\nIf the conditions are met, the player with the highest price will replace the original player. If all conditions are not met then the original player will continue. There is no limit on how many replacement players a team can receive. \n\nTiebreaker rules when two or more replacement players cost the same:    \n1. Safety Net will pick the player with the most ‘FORM’ points. ‘FORM’ is based on a player's point average from his/her last 5 games.   \n2. If the players have the same ‘FORM’ points, then Safety Net will pick the player with the most fantasy ‘POINTS’ for the whole season.   \n3. If the players share the same seasonal ‘POINTS', Safety Net will pick the player by alphabetical order.   \n\n### Points table\n\n |Action| Points | \n   |: ------------|-------------- |\n   | Participation  | 0.75 points  |\n   | Goal - Goalkeeper / Defender  | 6.5 points  |\n   | Goal - Forward  | 5 points  |\n   | Assist - Goalkeeper / Defender  | 4.5 points  |\n   | Assist - Forward  | 3 points  |\n   | Shorthanded goal/assist bonus  | 1 point  |\n   | Shootout goal  | 2 points  |\n   | Game-winning goal bonus (1) | 1 point |\n   | Shot on goal  | 0.25 points  |\n   | Block (2) | 0.5 points  |\n   | Hit (2) | 0.25 points  |\n   | Goal scored while on ice - Defender / Forward  | 0.25 points  |\n   | Goal conceded while on ice - Defender / Forward  | -0.25 points  |\n   | Goalkeepers: Goal conceded  | -1 point  |\n   | Goalkeepers: Save  | 0.2 points  |\n   | Goalkeepers: Shutout (clean sheet) (3) | 4 points  |\n   | Goalkeepers: Win (4) | 3 points  |\n   | Goalkeepers: OT / shootout Win (4) | 2 points  |\n   | Goalkeepers: Save  | 0.2 points  |\n   | Minor penalty (2 min)  | -0.5 points  |\n   | Double Minor penalty (4 min)  | -1 point  |\n   | Major penalty (5 min)  | -1.25 points  |\n   | Misconduct / Game misconduct  | -2.5 points  |\n\n1) Game-winning goal bonus is awarded to the player who scored the goal that gave the lead to their team, which led them to win the game.\n\n2) If a league does not register these events officially, no points will be awarded.\n\n3) Shutout (clean sheet) bonus is awarded to a Goalkeeper if he has played for the whole duration of the match without conceding a goal.\n\n4) Only the goalkeeper who was on the ice when the game-winning goal was scored is awarded the Win bonus.",
        "some_answer_fantasy_6": "![Tennis player](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg.net/support-pages/sgn-tennismini.jpg){.right .ml-s .m-s}   \nIn tennis, a team consists of six players. There are two main formats in daily fantasy tennis:   \n- Standard 6: The team consists of three men and three women.   \n- Flexi 6: Any combination of men and women is allowed.    \n\nBoth formats can have either one captain or none. When there is a captain, he gets double the amount of points.   \n   \n#### Multi-gameweek tournaments   \nWhile daily fantasy tennis typically run for just one day (or “gameweek”), fantasy competitions that run for several gameweeks exist from time to time. This type of competition can be used for big tournaments like Wimbledon and use the same points scoring system as daily fantasy tennis. For multi-gameweek tennis, we typically use an 8 player format; 4 men and 4 women. There are often no transfers or substitutions in multi-gameweek tennis.\n\n#### Interrupted, postponed and cancelled matches \nIf a match is interrupted or postponed because of weather or other reason that is not due to a particular player, the fantasy tournament will be on hold until the match has been finished, unless official records say the match has been abandoned for good (in which case, both players will get 0 points).\n\n#### Player retirement (NEW)   \nIf a player withdraws during the game, the rest of the match will be played out by default, with the winning player awarded with all the remaining games & sets of the match. No extra points will be awarded for breaks, aces & double faults. Straight set bonus will still apply as a normal match.   \nExample: if the player won 1st set by 6-3, but is behind in the 2nd set by 1-4 and then his opponent withdraws, the player will get 6-3, 6-4 and 6-0 in this example (if it is a best of 5 sets match). The player who withdraws, will get 3-6, 4-6 and 0-6.   \n\nIf a player withdraws before the game or a player is replaced by another before the match has started, we will give the winning player a compensation of 32 points plus the match win of 2.5 points. The player who did not show will get 0 points.   \n\n#### The points system\nThe point system is designed to reward tennis players who win big. The more superior a player is, the more points will be assigned to him/her. A player that loses big will get very few points. In extreme cases negative points can be awarded. Please note that a player that loses a game narrowly still can accumulate a nice chunk of points, as he has put up a fight and should be rewarded for that.\n\nFor keeping track of the points in a set, a lot depends on how mange games are won and lost by the player. If the difference between won and lost games is one or two, the points awarded to the player are less than if the difference is bigger. The opponent will get more points if he only loses by one or two games in a set.\n\nThe difference in won and lost games will result in points awarded even when the set is on-going. Worth noting is that these are temporarily points and they can change a lot during a set. Once the set has been finished, final points for that part of the match will be awarded.\n\n#### Straight sets and Losing only 1 set bonuses\nSSB is given for winning all the sets in a match and LO1SB is given for losing only 1 set. It does not matter for the bonuses whether the final set is won by gameplay or by retirement. However, points for Match Win or Win by Retirement are not included in the calculation of bonuses.  \n\nStraight Sets Bonus is calculated like this: All points accumulated in the sets for a player are multiplied by the SSB factor, which is 0.67 for bof5 and 0.50 for bof3.  \n\nLosing Only 1 Set Bonus is calculated like this: All points accumulated in the sets for a player are multiplied by the factor, which is 0.25 for bof5. There is no LO1SB for bof3.\n\n\n#### Points scoring table   \n\n   |Action| Best of 5 sets | Best of 3 sets |\n   |: ------------|-------------- |-------------- |\n   | Won completed match  | 2.5 points  | 2.5 points  |\n   | Aces  | 0.2 points | 0.3 points  |\n   | Double faults | -0.3 points | -0.5 points  |\n   | Breaks | 1.0 points | 1.5 points |\n   | Broken serve | -0.4 points | -0.6 points  |\n   | More than 15 aces bonus (more than 10 in a best of 3 set match)  | 1.5 points| 1.5 points  |\n   | Straight sets bonus   | 0.67x  | 0.5x  |\n   | Losing only 1 set bonus   | 0.25x | N/A  |\n   | Winning set by tie break | 6.5 points | 10.0 points  |\n   | Winning (leading) set by 2 games  | 8.0 points | 12.0 points |\n   | Winning (leading) set by 3 games | 9.5 points | 14.0 points  |\n   | Winning (leading) set by 4 games   | 10.5 points  | 16.0 points  |\n   | Winning (leading) set by 5 games | 11.0 points | 16.5 points  |\n   | Winning (leading) set by 6 games  | 12.0 points  | 18.0 points  |\n   | Losing set by tie break  | 5.5 points | 8.0 points  |\n   | Losing set by 2 games | 4.0 points | 6.0 points  |\n   | Losing set by 3 games  | 2.5 points | 3.5 points  |\n   | Losing set by 4 games | 1.5 points | 2.5 points  |\n   | Losing set by 5 games   | 1.0 points  | 1.5 points  |\n   | Losing set by 6 games | -1.0 points | -1.5 points  |\n   | Win by retirement before the match ¢)  | 32.0 points | 32.0 points  |\n \n¢) Points for Win by retirement will be in addition to points for Complete match win.   \n\nDefinitions\nStraight sets = Winning all sets in a match.\nTie break = If the score in a set is 6-6, they will play only one more game, and the winner of that game wins the set.",

        "some_answer_soccer_10": "All tournaments on Fanteam have a guaranteed prize pool. Even if there are not enough entries to pay for the prize pool, the guarantee will stand, and we will pay out the promised amount.\nThe guaranteed amount is just a minimum (worst case) number. If there are more entries than is required to pay for the guarantee, the prize pool will simply get bigger than the guarantee and we will pay out even more!\n\n#### Example 1:   \nIn a €20 buy-in tournament (where the rake is €2), the guarantee is €50,000. If there are 2,500 entries, we will get €5,000 in rake. But the prize pool is short, as €18 x 2,500 = €45,000. So the €5,000 in rake is paid back to the pool, as €5,000 is exactly what is missing for the prize pool to reach €50,000. \n\n#### Example 2:    \nThe same tournament, but now there are 3,300 entries. We have €18 x 3,300 = €59,400, which is the new prize pool. At this point, the guarantee becomes irrelevant, as obviously we want the bigger prize pool for our players. Note that the rake per entry (in this case €2) will always remain the same, regardless of reaching the guarantee or not. Of course, we do not take extra money out of the prize pool just because we go over the guarantee! \n\n#### Why do we have a limited number of seats?    \nIn the spring of 2019 we started with a limit on seats, which meant that a tournament could be sold out. While not obvious at first glance, limiting seats actually have a couple of advantages. With it in place, players enter tournaments at an earlier time, as they are afraid to miss out. We have also seen that the numbers of entries actually get higher when we limit the seats, which is good for both our players and us. \n    \nSo far, we have mostly set the limit at a level where the guarantee will be reached, but not much higher than that. In September of 2019 we start to increase the number of seats, so it corresponds to a level higher than the guarantees, for example 20 per cent higher. The effect of this will be good, both for players and for Fanteam, as it has been very difficult to predict the attendance correctly in all the tournaments. Now, we will still have some extra seats available even in cases where we set the guarantee too low. Bear in mind, tournaments can still sell out, though. In general, we think this will lead to bigger prize pools, which is what we are all hoping for!",

        "some_answer_soccer_14": "It is crunch time for the biggest European tournament, and of course there is a big tournament for that! The prizepool is guaranteed to be at least €250,000, but there are those who predict it may sell out at €300,000! Make sure you don't get left out!  \n\nIt is challenging to create a semi-seasonal tournament where half of the clubs are knocked out for each round. That's why we chose the freeze format last year. Not entirely satisfied with how that panned out, and listening to our loyal customers, we decided to do it differently this time. It should be a lot of fun! \n    \n#### The format   \nYou pick 11 players. No subs. Football Safety Net will apply. Captain will receive double points. If the captain does not play, the vice captain will get double points. There is no stacking penalty. There is a mix of free transfers and wildcards, as detailed here:\n\n- GW7: Phase 16 - 1st leg (you can make unlimited number of changes before this gameweek)   \n- GW8: Phase 16 - 2nd leg (You can make 3 free transfers before this round)   \n- GW9: Quarterfinals - 1st leg (You get a wildcard that must be used before this round)   \n- GW10: Quarterfinals - 2nd leg (You can make 3 free transfers before this round)   \n- GW11: Semifinals - 1st leg + 2nd leg + Final (You get a wildcard that must be used before this round   \n\nIMPORTANT: As both semifinals and the final are placed in the same gameweek, you will not be allowed to make changes to your team after the GW5 deadline has passed! You have to stick with your team, so try to find players that will not only do well in the semi, but actually will play the final!\n\nThe wildcards will only be available in the periods BETWEEN GW2 and GW3, and GW4 and GW5. For gameweeks that have 3 FT's, you can transfer more, at the expense of -4 points per extra transfer. Unused free transfers cannot be saved for later gameweeks.\n\nThe maximum number of players from any club is 3 in the first four gameweeks. In GW5 the max is 5 players from any club.\n      \n#### When does the tournament start?    \nIt starts on February 16th. \n\n#### What is the buy-in of the final?\nIt is €25. €20 goes towards the prize pool.    \n\n#### Is there a transfer window before each gameweek, when i cannot make changes?\nYes, there is a 90 minute window. Please make sure you do all your changes before that!\n\n#### What is the first prize?   \nThe winner will get €25,000. What would YOU want to use that kind of money for?\n    \n#### But there will be nice prizes to a lot of places, right?\nExactly! We decided that the top 10 all will get €3,100 or more. In some cases MUCH MORE! In total there are 2513 prizes, the lowest ones are €35. If there are more entries than the guarantee is based on, we will add/increase prizes correspondingly. If there are less entries, obviously the guarantee will stand.   \n\n#### Is there a maximum number of entries I can have in the tournament?\nYes, it is 50. \n\n#### Can I register late in this tournament?\nYes, you can register until the start of gameweek 2. If you miss gameweek 1, you will get compensation points equal to 75% of the average score in gameweek 1.\n\n#### Will prices change during the tournament?\nNo, but the budget can change. Obviously, the budget for GW2 must be the same as GW1, and GW4 must be the same as GW3. However, the budget may be changed when we reach GW3 as it depends on how many expensive clubs reached this round. Even more probable is a change in budget when we reach GW5. Otherwise we could find ourselves not being able to afford players from the finalists.\n\n\n#### Special CL Knockout phase rules for postponed matches\nAs there is increased risk for matches in Champions League to be postponed in these challenging times, these are the postponement rules for CL Knockout phase:          \n\n- If matches are postponed, they will still count. We will wait for the missing matches to be played. They will keep their place in the gameweek they were originally scheduled to be in. \n\n- The exception to this would be if UEFA decides to not play certain matches at all. For example making a round one-legged for one or more clubs. Players that find themselves with one match less to score points in will simply get 0 points for the cancelled match.\n\nIf a match is interrupted, and play is resumed at a later time, points will be awarded as usual. If a match is interrupted, but never resumed, points accumulated until the interruption will count. \n\n\n#### How will safety net work in GW11 where clubs can have up to 3 fixtures?\nAs long as your original player starts one of the matches in the gameweek, you will get points from all his matches in that gameweek.    \nIf he does not start the first match (but comes on as sub), he will get a replacement, that may or may not be temporary. If he then starts in a later match in the same gameweek, you will get all the points the original player accumulates in all matches he has been involved in, in that gameweek (and the temporary replacement disappears from your team).       \n\n#### Total prizes: Minimum €250,000!   \n\n| Position     | Prize level  |  Places    | Total  |\n| :----------- | :----------: | :--------: |-------:|\n|  1st         |  €25000      |    1       | €25000 | \n|  2nd         |  €15000      |    1       | €15000 | \n|  3rd         |  €10000      |    1       | €10000 | \n|  4th         |   €8300      |    1       |  €8300 | \n|  5th         |   €7100      |    1       |  €7100 | \n|  6th         |   €6100      |    1       |  €6100 | \n|  7th         |   €5200      |    1       |  €5200 | \n|  8th         |   €4400      |    1       |  €4400 | \n|  9th         |   €3700      |    1       |  €3700 | \n|  10th        |   €3100      |    1       |  €3100 | \n|  11th        |   €2600      |    1       |  €2600 | \n|  12th        |   €2200      |    1       |  €2200 | \n|  13th        |   €1800      |    1       |  €1800 | \n|  14th        |   €1500      |    1       |  €1500 | \n|  15th        |   €1300      |    1       |  €1300 | \n|  16th        |   €1100      |    1       |  €1100 | \n|  17th        |    €900      |    1       |   €900 | \n|  18th        |    €800      |    1       |   €800 | \n|  19th        |    €700      |    1       |   €700 | \n|  20-21       |    €625      |    2       |  €1250 | \n|  22-23       |    €550      |    2       |  €1100 | \n|  24-25       |    €500      |    2       |  €1000 | \n|  26-30       |    €450      |    5       |  €2250 | \n|  31-40       |    €400      |   10       |  €4000 | \n|  41-50       |    €350      |   10       |  €3500 | \n|  51-60       |    €300      |   10       |  €3000 | \n|  61-70       |    €260      |   10       |  €2600 | \n|  71-80       |    €230      |   10       |  €2300 | \n|  81-90       |    €210      |   10       |  €2100 | \n|  91-100      |    €190      |   10       |  €1900 | \n|  101-120     |    €175      |   20       |  €3500 | \n|  121-140     |    €160      |   20       |  €3200 | \n|  141-160     |    €145      |   20       |  €2900 | \n|  161-180     |    €130      |   20       |  €2600 | \n|  181-200     |    €115      |   20       |  €2300 | \n|  201-250     |    €100      |   50       |  €5000 | \n|  251-300     |     €85      |   50       |  €4250 | \n|  301-400     |     €75      |  100       |  €7500 | \n|  401-500     |     €65      |  100       |  €6500 | \n|  501-700     |     €55      |  200       | €11000 | \n|  701-1000    |     €50      |  300       | €15000 | \n|  1001-1500   |     €45      |  500       | €22500 | \n|  1501-2000   |     €40      |  500       | €20000 | \n|  2001-2513   |     €35      |  513       | €17955 |",
        "some_answer_soccer_15": "The number of fantasy players keeps growing, and it allows us to open our biggest tournament to date! A tournament for the whole 2020 EURO Championship, including both the group stage and the knockout phase!   \nThe European football championship should have been played last summer, but was of course postponed because of the covid-19 pandemic. Now it is set to be played in the summer of 2021, giving us a great opportunity to build the biggest fantasy tournament yet, with a guaranteed prize pool of €1,150,000! Or, if you are playing the tournament from the UK, £1,000,000! The first prize will be €230,000! Would you have any use for that kind of money?   \n\n#### Format   \nPick a squad of 15 players. For each gameweek, select 11 of them to play, while letting 4 be subs. Select a captain and a vice captain. If your captain does not play at all in the gameweek, your vice captain will get double points. \n\n#### Schedule   \nThere will be 7 gameweeks:   \nGameweek 1 (11 - 15 June): Group Stage - Matchday 1   \nGameweek 2 (16 - 19 June): Group Stage - Matchday 2   \nGameweek 3 (20 - 23 June): Group Stage- Matchday 3   \nGameweek 4 (26 - 28 June): Round of 16   \nGameweek 5 (02 - 03 July): Quarterfinals   \nGameweek 6 (06 - 07 July): Semifinals   \nGameweek 7 (11 July): Finals  \n\n#### Transfers and wildcards   \nGroup stage: 1 free transfer per gameweek   \nRound of 16: Wildcard (must be used between gameweek 3 and 4)   \nQuarterfinals: 3 free transfers   \nSemifinals: 3 free transfers   \nFinal: No transfers, but changing captains and which player you will have on the bench is allowed   \n  \n- Additional transfers are allowed - with a 4 points penalty per excess transfer - for all gameweeks, except for the final.   \n- Saving unused transfers is allowed -  but max 1 more. This means, you can use 2 for the QF, and then have 4 for the SF. However, not spending all your transfers in SF will not give you any transfers for the final.     \n\nMaximum number of players from any nation:   \nGroup stage: 3   \nRound of 16: 3   \nQuarterfinals: 4   \nSemifinals: 7   \nFinal: 7   \n\n#### The buy-in\nIt is €23. Out of this, €20.00 goes towards the prize pool.   \nIf your account has UK currency, the buy-in is £20. Out of this, £17.40 goes towards the prize pool.  \nIf we do not reach the required number of entries to pay for the guarantee (57,500), we will of course still pay out the full amount. If we get more entries than that, the prize pool obviously will be increased accordingly.   \n\n#### Late registration: Until start of gameweek 2   \nIt will be possible to join after the first gameweek starts, as long as gameweek 2 has not started yet. A late registrant will get compensation points for the round he missed: 100% of the average score in the missed rounds.   \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nAll changes to your team need to be done 90 minutes or longer before the start of the gameweek. This way, you do not have to wait until the final hour, you can make changes whenever you have time! The exception is changes to teams that have not started their first gameweek yet. So, when you enter the tournament in GW1 (or GW2), you can make changes until kick-off of the first match in the gameweek.\n\n#### Price changes   \nPlayer prices will not change before the first match starts, but can change while the tournament is ongoing. Changes will be based on performance of the players and can happen every day, between 24:00 and 02:00 CET. The price you see for a specific player is what it costs to buy him, and it is also the amount you will receive when you sell him. There is no tax when you sell players. There will not be price changes between the start of gameweek 3 and start of gameweek 4.   \n\n#### Budget changes   \nPlayers may find that they will have more or less money to spend on their team, than what they started out with. This is because player prices can change during the tournament.   \nWe may also increase budgets for R16, QF and SF. The reason is that we may find ourselves in a situation late in the tournament where only expensive players remain for selection, so the budget would need to be increased. In such cases, everyone will receive the same increase. If the general increase is +5M, and your team value is 102M, you now have 107M to spend. Budget changes will be done as soon as possible, once all matches for the next gameweek are known.      \n\n#### Wildcards   \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers throughout a gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.   \nThere is one wildcard available to you in this tournament. It will become visible after gameweek 3 has started, and must be used before gameweek 4 starts.   \nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcard does not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \n\n#### Substitutes   \nYou have to select four substitutes: Three outfield players and one goalkeeper. Please note, that these are ordered in priority from left to right, meaning your primary substitute is the one on the farthest left.   \nIf one or more players among your starters did not play in the match at all, the system will automatically substitute the non-playing player with the 1st available substitute. If your first substitute did not play, the system will move on to the next substitute and see if he played.\nImportant! The system will not put in a sub if it results in an illegal formation. It is always required to have at least three defenders, one midfielder and one forward.\n\n#### No safety net    \nAs is the norm when we have subs, there is no safety net activated for this tournament.   \n\n#### Special EURO 2020 rules for postponed matches    \nThe special postponement rules for this tournament overrides the general football rules on the subject.      \n- If matches are postponed, they will still count. We will wait for the missing matches to be played. They will keep their place in the gameweek they were originally scheduled to be in. \n \n- The exception to this would be if UEFA decides to not play certain matches at all. Players that find themselves with one match less to score points in will simply get 0 points for the cancelled match.\n\nIf a match is interrupted, and play is resumed at a later time, points will be awarded as usual. If a match is interrupted, but never resumed, points accumulated until the interruption will count.\n\n#### Extraordinary circumstances   \n\nMainly due to the ongoing impact of Covid on the football landscape, there’s the possibility of unexpected circumstances occurring. We will act as follows if needs be:   \n\n- Euro 2020 suspended, but remains within the summer 2021 calendar - Euro 2020 fantasy tournaments suspended until Euro 2020 resumes.   \n- Euro 2020 rearranged for a period outside of summer 2021 (e.g. summer 2022) - Euro 2020 fantasy tournaments cancelled and entries treated as follows:   \nCash entries and ticket entries won through Satellites - refunded in full  \nTicket entries won through promos - alternative tickets provided   \n- Whole country removed from tournament, another country added e.g. Russia removed from tournament, Republic of Ireland added - the new country would be added to the player pool and selectable from the following gameweek  \n- Additional players added to squads e.g. UEFA allow Brahim Diaz to be called up by Spain - the additional player would be added to the player pool and selectable from the following gameweek.   \n \n#### Satellites   \nThe buy-in for this tournament is €23. However, it is possible to qualify through cheap satellites, running in many different leagues and sports. Entries to the season game won through satellites can not be exchanged for cash or sold, they have to be used by the same user who played the satellite.\n\n#### Total prizes: Minimum €1,150,000!   \nThe guarantee for EURO 2020 is a record-breaking €1,150,000! Please note that the guarantee means that €1,150,000 will be paid out even if the number of entries is less than 57,500. This is how all our guarantees work.

        "some_answer_soccer_16": "We are delighted to announce the opening of our 2022/23 Fantasy Premier League FIRST HALF Season Game, which has a minimum guaranteed prize pool of €200,000.\n\nDue to the 2022 World Cup taking place halfway through the Premier League season, we’ve decided to change things up a little this year, by offering a First Half only season game, which will finish and be paid out in time for users to enjoy and participate in our massive World Cup fantasy game.\n\n#### Buy-in    \nThe buy-in is €20 with €16.60 going towards the prize pool. \n\n#### The guarantee: €200,000    \nThat is the minimum prize pool for this tournament. We do expect it to go over the guarantee, and if that happens, the prize pool will grow accordingly (by €16.60 per additional entry). We need 12 048 entries to cover the guarantee, but of course if we do not get that many, we will still pay out the €200,000. It would not be a guarantee otherwise!\n\nThe first prize is guaranteed to be at least €20,000, but it will get bigger if we go over the guarantee, as it will be minimum 10% of the total prize pool. There will be prizes for top 20% of the field, based on the number of entries in the tournament.  \n\n#### Max number of entries per user: 10 (NEW)\nThis is an important change from previous years season games. Many users got tired of seeing 50 or 100 identical teams from some participants, pushing other users down the prize list. This year we have decided to set the max number of entries at 10, which is a radical change, and something we think many of our customers will welcome. It does come with a cost however, as the prize pool will be smaller than it otherwise would be.  But we think many people will be happy to not have to see those enormous \"trains\". The decision will help us achieve our goal of making the fantasy competitions more beginner-friendly.   \n\n#### No linking of identical teams (NEW)   \nThe linking of identical teams feature has been partially eliminated, in the interest of reducing the number of identical teams that worsen the user experience for others, especially in season games.   \n\n**What you still can do**   \nEnter the same team in different tournaments with the same format. You need to do this at the same time, through the \"Also participate in...\" window. Such entries will be linked, so a change to one of them can be automatically applied to the others if you choose to. (Note that if you at some point make a change to one team that you don't do to the other, then they are un-linked and there is no going back.)   \n\n**What you cannot do anymore**   \nEnter a number of identical teams in a single tournament and expect them to be linked. They will not be. Also, you cannot make a change to a team, in order to make it identical to another, and expect them to be linked. They will not be.   \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or change your starting XI after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Friday night, for example. Please note that while there is late reg for this tournament (see below), you MUST register before the 90 minute window in order to compete in that gameweek.\n\n#### Transfers: Save up unlimited (NEW)\nFor season-long Premier League tournament there’s one free transfer given between each gameweek. If you don't use your free transfer one week, you can do two free transfers the following week. In this tournament you can save up as many free transfers as you want! Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. There is no limit to the number of changes you can make to your team when you are entering the competition.\n\n#### Wildcards  \nYou have one wildcard in this tournament. You can use this at any time.  \n  \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers for the next gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.      \nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcards do not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you have saved-up free transfers when you decide to use your wildcard, your saved-up transfers will be zero'ed out and you will start the following gameweek with 1 FT.   \n\n#### Substitutes   \nYou have to select four substitutes: Three outfield players and one goalkeeper. Please note, that the outfield players are ordered in priority from left to right, meaning your primary substitute is the one on the farthest left.   \nIf one or more players among your starters did not play in the match at all, the system will automatically substitute the non-playing player with the 1st available substitute. If your first substitute did not play, the system will move on to the next substitute and see if he played.\nImportant! The system will not put in a sub if it results in an illegal formation. It is always required to have at least three defenders, two midfielders and one forward.\nBecause we have subs, there is no safety net feature activated for this tournament. \n\n#### Budget and formations   \nYour starting budget to build a 15-player squad is 100M. Your funds can increase or decrease, as players' prices can change. You must have 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. Out of these you must field 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders, at least two midfielders, and at least 1 forward as your primary starting XI for the upcoming gameweek.    \n\nYou can choose maximum 3 players from the same club. If a player is sold to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4 (provided they are in your starting XI). However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as it will not let you store a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule.   \n \n####  What is new in the scoring rules?  \nNothing! If you have played a season game with us the last year, or even a daily fantasy tournament like the Weekly Monster, you already know the scoring rules!\n\nIf you do not know them, please take a look at the article in this section, called Fantasy Football rules (it is at the top of the section). The most important events are of course goals, assists and clean sheets.     \n\n#### Late registration: Until gameweek 3 \nIt will be possible to join the 200k game after the season starts, as long as the 90 minute deadline for gameweek 3 has not passed yet. Beware that a late reg team must be entered at least 90 minutes before kick-off of the first match in the gameweek, to compete in that gameweek. Similarly, all changes to such a team must be done before the 90 minute window, for the changes to take effect in the upcoming gameweek. \n\nA late registrant will get compensation points: 95% of the average score in the gameweeks he missed.\n\n#### About player price changes   \n- Price changes will occur once each gameweek, in a single batch.  \n- The changes will always take place within 48hrs of the last match concluding in a gameweek (with the exception of the first set of changes, see below).   \n- There will be no price changes in Gameweek 1, 2 or 3.   \n- The first set of price changes will occur once the first match of Gameweek 4 starts.   \n- From Gameweek 4 onwards price changes will occur weekly through to Gameweek 37.   \n- Price changes will be based on player form, using our in-house xFP (expected Fantasy Points) metrics. We will not be providing the full method used here, but be assured it will remain consistent and has been thoroughly tested prior to the season getting underway.   \n- There will be a maximum of 20 price rises, and 20 player falls, per gameweek. These do not have to be balanced e.g. there could be 16 rises and only 7 falls in a gameweek.   \n- No player will drop below our price floor of £4.0m.   \n- Price rises / falls will generally be 0.1 per week, and falls will only ever be in 0.1 increments. Players can however rise by 0.2 or 0.3 in a gameweek if they hit certain criteria, but this will be rare.   \n- Players who have moved in price will be posted on our Discord and Twitter accounts each gameweek.",

ONE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEASON (TO BE USED BEFORE THE GW20 KICK-OFF DEADLINE) AND ONE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON.\n\n### Wildcard section   \n**What is a wildcard?** A wildcard allows you to make unlimited free transfers throughout a Gameweek. For example, you may want to play your wildcard if your team is underperforming, you have lots of injuries or players are playing more than once. When using your wildcard you must still stay within your budget. \n\n**When can I use my wildcard?**   \nYou can use your wildcard twice in a season. Once in the first half of the season (to be used before Tue 28th Dec 13.30 BST - GW20 deadline) and once in the second half of the season. \n\n**What happens to my saved transfer when I use my wildcard?**   \nWhen playing a wildcard, any saved free transfers will be lost. You will be back to 1 free transfer the following Gameweek. Also any transfers made in that GW before setting the wildcard will not be saved. Your team will revert back to how it was before the gameweek started. \n\n**Can I cancel my wildcard?**   \nNo. Once you have confirmed your wildcard it is final and cannot be reversed.\nDo all transfers have to be made at the same time when using my wildcard? No. Any transfers you make within that Gameweek are free up until the next deadline.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions   \n**Can I make changes to my team during the gameweek?**   \nAny changes you make (starting 11, transfers, captain changes, substitution priorities) after the Gameweek deadline, will not take effect until the following deadline.   \n\n**What formation can I play in?**  \nYou can play in any formation, providing 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders, at least 2 midfielders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.\n\n**Can I cancel my transfers?**   \nNo. Once you have confirmed your transfers they can’t be reversed.\n\n**What happens when a team is playing twice in one gameweek?**  \nAny players you have from the team playing twice will earn two sets of points, assuming that the player plays in both fixtures. Any team captains playing in two fixtures will also earn double points for each match he plays in.\n\n**What happens if a team does not have a fixture in a gameweek?**   \nAny players you have from that team will score 0 for that Gameweek. Players will play twice in a future Gameweek, when the match is rescheduled. Points are only awarded to teams who have players selected in their team in the Gameweek the fixture is actually played, irrespective of if you had them selected for the original fixture.\n\n**Does it matter which order I select my substitutes?**   \nOutfield players are ordered in priority from left to right, meaning your primary substitute is the one on the furthest left. If one or more players among your starters did not play in the match at all, the system will automatically substitute the non-playing player with the 1st available substitute. However, the system will not put in a sub if it results in an illegal formation.    \n   \n![Scoring](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg-stg.net/support-pages/dreamsport-scoring-system.jpg)   \n   \n### What counts as a shot on target?   \nA shot on target is simply a shot that’s going in, but is stopped by the last line of defence. This could be a goalkeeper, an opposing player ‘on the line’, or even your own teammate if they’re goal hanging! \nPoints for a shot on target are not awarded when a goal is scored from the shot, either if the player is the scorer or is awarded the assist.\n\n### You can win money without risking anything!\nAs it is completely free to play on Dreamsport, you compete for money prizes without any risk! Manage your team as best you can through the season, and if you do well enough, there is money to be made!

Points hits will be counted, so you can’t just take multiple hits. If you filter the contest leaderboard by the month you will see your position.  \n\n#### €500 Prize Pool for the Highest Single Gameweek Score\nSeason game not going well? Fear not. This season there will be plenty to play for all season-long. We have a huge £500 prize pool for users who can achieve the highest gameweek score. That’s the equivalent of coming 3rd!

Please note transfer deductions will **NOT** be included in your score and scores from blank gameweeks (where more than two teams aren’t playing) are **NOT** eligible. \n    \n*All of the above special prize pools will be shared equally in the event of a tie.*\n\n### Late Registration   \nLate Registration will be available for 3 weeks after the start of Gameweek 1. This means Late Registration teams can be entered before Gameweeks 2, 3 and 4 deadlines, and they will begin scoring points from that gameweek deadline onwards. \n\nLate entries will receive 95% of the average score. For example, if you enter a late reg team for the start of Gameweek 2, you will receive 95% of the average score of every entry into Gameweek 1. If you enter a team for the start of Gameweek 3, you will receive 95% of the average score of every entry of Gameweeks 1 & 2 combined. \n\nThe deadline for making transfers & team changes for late registration entries will be 90 minutes before the first kick-off. \n\n### Links and Useful Information   \n[Premier League fixtures] (https://www.premierleague.com/news/2171434)   \n\n#### How do I know what the Dream Team of the Gameweek is?\nThe players that make the Dream Team will get a little star next to them at the end of the Gameweek. You can check how many you have by searching for your teams on the leaderboard and seeing how many stars you have.   \n\n![Gameplay 10k](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg-stg.net/support-pages/gameplay.jpg)",
        "some_answer_soccer_18": "It is time to say hello to our season-style fantasy tournament for the Champions League group stage! Compete over 6 gameweeks for a guaranteed prizepool of €250,000 and a first prize of €50,000! It's worth noting that while it is a season-style game where you keep your team - more or less - from one gameweek to the next, there are no subs. Instead, we will use safety net for players that do not start their matches. There are 2 free transfers per gameweek and no wildcard. The fun starts on September 14th! That is actually a deadline set in stone, as late reg is not allowed in this tournament.\n\n#### What is the buy-in?   \nThe buy-in is €20. €16.60 of that goes towards the prize pool. If there are fewer entries than the guarantee requires, we will still pay out the €250,000. If there are more entries, the prize pool will be increased accordingly. \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or select a new different captain after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Monday night, for example. \n\n#### Transfers   \nThere are 2 free transfers given per gameweek and you can save up to 2 transfers. The maximum number of free transfers is therefore 4. Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. There is no limit on the number of free transfers as long as GW1 has not started.\n\n#### Price changes   \nThere will be no player price changes.\n\n#### Wildcards   \nThere are no wildcards. \n\n#### Substitutes/Safety Net   \nThere are no subs. Instead we will use safety net, as commonly used in our daily fantasy tournaments. If your player does not start his match, he will be replaced (for that gameweek) with the next player on the list. Please refer to Safety Net section if you are not familiar with the priority list. In short, safety net will make a reasonable choice for you.\n\n#### Budget and formations   \nYour starting budget to build an 11-player team is 100M. You must have 1 goalkeeper, 3-5 defenders, 2-5 midfielders and 1-3 forwards. Your team cannot include more than 3 players from the same club.   \n\nYou can choose a maximum of 3 players from the same club. If a player is sold to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4 (provided they are in your starting XI). However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as it will not let you save a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule.   \n \n#### What is new in the scoring rules?   \nNothing is brand new, but compared to last season CL group stage game, there are two changes you should be aware of:   \n- Points for a player's team winning/losing in the period he is on the pitch have been reduced from +/-1.0 to +/-0.3.   \n- Shots on Target are now counted. 0.4p for midfielders/forwards, 0.6p for defenders and 1.0p for keepers.  \n \nCheck the definition of Shot on Target and other parts of the rules in the separate section \"Fantasy Football Rules\".   \n\n#### No late registration \nAs the tournament's duration is only 6 gameweeks, we will not allow late reg. Make sure that you don't miss GW1!\n\n#### Satellites   \nThe buy-in for the PL season game is €20. However, it is possible to qualify through cheap satellites, running in many different leagues and sports. Check out the huge satellites for World Cup qualification, with buy-ins of €2 and €4.

        "some_answer_soccer_19": "We are delighted to announce the opening of our Fantasy Premier League SECOND CHANCE Season Game! It is free to enter and you can win big prizes! If you have played the PL season game you know that season games are great fun! If you have fallen too far behind in the season game, or missed it completely, here is your chance to start fresh in a new, big tournament! Also, do not forget to tell your friends - all they need to participate for free is a verified account!   \n\n#### When does it start?      \nThe contest will begin at CET 21:00/GMT 20:00 on January 14th 2022 - the start of gameweek 22. It will run through to the end of the Premier League season.  \n\n#### What is the buy-in?   \nEntering is completely free! All verified accounts will receive one free ticket to enter! However, you can enter more than once for £10 per additional entry. \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or change your starting XI after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Fridays, for example. Please note that while there is late reg for this tournament (see below), you MUST register before the 90 minute window in order to compete in that gameweek.\n\n#### Number of transfers   \nThere’s one free transfer allowed between each gameweek. Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. If you don't use your free transfer one week, you can do two free transfers the following week. NOTE: In this game, you can have an unlimited number of saved transfers. There is no limit on the number of free transfers when your team is entering the competition.\n\n#### Price changes   \nPlayer price changes will occur during this tournament in sync with the regular PL season game. All such changes happen within 48 hours of a gameweek finishing. \n\n- Price changes will be based on player form, using our in-house xFP (expected Fantasy Points) metrics.   \n- Price changes will occur once each gameweek, in a single batch. The changes will always take place within 48 hours of the last match concluding in a gameweek.   \n- There will be a maximum of 20 price rises, and 20 player falls, per gameweek. These do not have to be balanced e.g. there could be 16 rises and only 7 falls in a gameweek.   \n- No player will drop below our price floor of £4.0m.   \n- Price rises/falls will generally be 0.1 per week, and falls will only ever be in 0.1 increments. Players can however rise by 0.2 or 0.3 in a gameweek if they hit certain criteria, but this will be rare.   \n\nThe price you see for a specific player is what it costs to buy him, and it is the amount you will receive when you sell him. There is no tax when you sell players, so the actual price of the player when you sell him is the amount you will receive. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you buy a player before the tournament starts, and sell him before the tournament starts, you will not receive the profit if his price has increased in the meantime. (You will not receive a loss either, of course). \n\n#### Wildcards   \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers for the next gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.   \nThere is one wildcard available to you in this tournament. It can be activated for any gameweek.  \nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcards do not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \nPlease note any saved transfers will be removed when a wildcard is activated. Users will be left with one transfer the week after using their wildcard.   \n\n#### Substitutes   \nThere are no subs in this game. Your squad consists of 11 players, all will be in play in any gameweek.\n\n#### Safety net   \nBecause there are no subs, we will enable the safety net feature: If one or more of your players does not start the match, safety net will aim to find a replacement so that you will still have players who potentially plays the full match. Safety net is looking for:   \n- A player from the same team   \n- A player playing in the same position   \n- The most expensive player that costs the same as the missing player, or less    \nAll three conditions have to be met, for safety net to be able to pick the replacement.  \n\n#### Safety net in double (or triple) gameweeks  \nIf your player starts (plays from the beginning) in either the first game, the second or the third game, he will be the chosen player.\nIf he does not, the system will look for a player that started in at least one of the matches, and put him in (provided one such player exists, same team, same position, same or lower price).   \n\n#### Budget and formations   \nYour starting budget to build an 11-player squad is 80M. It can increase or decrease, as players' prices can change. You must have 1 goalkeeper, and at least 3 defenders, 2 midfielders and 1 forward, but other than that you are free to use any formation you want. Your team cannot include more than 3 players from the same club.   \n\nIf a player is sold to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4 (provided they are in your starting XI). However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as it will not let you store a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule.   \n\nYou will need to pick a captain and a vice captain for each gameweek. Your captain will earn double points. If he does not play in the gameweek, your vice captain will get double points instead.   \n \n#### Late registration: One week \nIt is possible to register a team until the deadline of gameweek 23. A late registrant will get compensation points: 95% of the average score in gameweek 22.   \n\n#### Total prizes: £100,000!   \nThis tournament has a fixed prize pool of £100,000. It does not matter how many teams that are entered, this amount will not change.    \n\n\n| Position     | Prize level  |  Places    | Total  |\n| :----------- | :----------: | :--------: |-------:|\n|  1st         | £20000      |    1        | £20000 | \n|  2nd         |  £7500      |    1        |  £7500 | \n|  3rd         |  £2500      |    1        |  £2500 | \n|  4th         |  £1750      |    1        |  £1750 | \n|  5th         |  £1000      |    1        |  £1000 | \n|  6-15        |   £500      |   10        |  £5000 | \n|  16-20       |   £300      |    5        |  £1500 | \n|  21-30       |   £225      |   10        |  £2250 | \n|  31-35       |   £150      |    5        |   £750 | \n|  36-50       |   £100      |   15        |  £1500 | \n|  51-100      |    £50      |   50        |  £2500 | \n|  101-200     |    £45      |  100        |  £4500 | \n|  201-300     |    £40      |  100        |  £4000 | \n|  301-400     |    £35      |  100        |  £3500 | \n|  401-500     |    £30      |  100        |  £3000 | \n|  501-750     |    £25      |  250        |  £6250 | \n|  751-1000    |    £20      |  250        |  £5000 | \n|  1001-1500   |    £15      |  500        |  £7500 | \n|  1501-3000   |    £10      | 1500        | £15000 | \n|  3001-4000   |     £5      | 1000        |  £5000 |",

Follow the biggest football clubs in their hunt for European glory, while earning your share of the prize pool, which is guaranteed to be €250,000 regardless of the number of entries!

You can freely make changes to your team right up to this deadline.   \n\n#### What is the buy-in?   \nEach entry costs €25/£21. From this, €20.75/£17.43 goes into the prize pool.

If both the captain and vice captain are replaced, you have no captain. There is no stacking penalty.   \n\n#### How does safety net work?   \nIf you are not familiar with this feature, we encourage you to check out the article on the topic in the fantasy football section. But in short, safety net will look for a replacement player, if you have a player that does not start his match. In order to qualify, a replacement player must be start his match (or at least start at an earlier time in the match than the original player), cost the same or less, and play in the same position and for the same club as the original player.   \n\n#### Transfers and wildcards   \nFor each gameweek, we will alternate between a forced wildcard and 3 free transfers:   \n\nGW 7 - Round of 16, 1st leg. For this, you will have unlimited transfers until start of the first match.   \nGW 8 - Round of 16, 2nd leg. 3 free transfers.   \nGW 9 - Quarterfinals, 1st leg.

For gameweeks that have 3 FT's, you can transfer more, at the expense of -4 points per extra transfer. Unused free transfers cannot be saved for later gameweeks.   \n\nThe maximum number of players from any club is 3 for round of 16, 4 for quarterfinals, 5 for the semifinals, and 6 for the final.\n      \n#### Is there a non-transfer window, when I cannot make changes?\nYes, there is a 90 minute window before each gameweek.

In a round where there is a wildcard, you can simply make a new transfer without any penalty.\n\n#### Special CL Knockout phase rules for postponed matches   \nIf a game is played outside of its original gameweek window, players from those games will each receive xFP (50% of price).   \nIf the whole tournament is suspended at any point, gameweek dates will be reworked as required.   \nIf UCL is cancelled, then entries will be refunded. The tournament will only be paid out if and when the Champions League Final has been played.   \n\nIf a match is interrupted, and play is resumed at a later time, points will be awarded as usual. If a match is interrupted, but never resumed, points accumulated until the interruption will count. \n\n#### Will players score points in extra time and on penalties?\nNo. As is standard with our fantasy football rules, only events happening in ordinary time + injury time will result in fantasy points given.\n\n#### Guaranteed prize pool: €250,000!

        "some_answer_soccer_22": "Welcome to our 2022/23 Fantasy Premier League Full Season Game, which this year is a single entry tournament! Yes, we are going One Bullet with this, so that everybody has an equal chance to win! We think this gives it a more of a \"championship feeling\"!   \n\nWe also reduced the buy-in to €5, in order to make the game accessible to even more people around the world!    \n\n#### Buy-in    \nThe buy-in is €5 with €4.15 going towards the prize pool.   \n\n#### The guarantee: €25,000    \nThat is the minimum prize pool for this tournament. We do expect it to go over the guarantee, and if that happens, the prize pool will grow accordingly (by €4.15 per additional entry). We need 6,024 entries to cover the guarantee, but of course if we do not get that many, we will still pay out the €25,000. It would not be a guarantee otherwise!   \n\nThe first prize is guaranteed to be at least €2,500, but it will get bigger if we go over the guarantee, as it will be minimum 10% of the total prize pool. There will be prizes for top 20% of the field, based on the number of entries in the tournament.  \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or change your starting XI after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Friday night, for example. Please note that while there is late reg for this tournament (see below), you MUST register before the 90 minute window in order to compete in that gameweek.\n\n#### Transfers: Save up unlimited (NEW)\nFor season-long Premier League tournament there’s one free transfer given between each gameweek. If you don't use your free transfer one week, you can do two free transfers the following week. In this tournament you can save up as many free transfers as you want! Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. There is no limit to the number of changes you can make to your team when you are entering the competition.\n\n#### Wildcards   \nYou have two wildcards in this tournament. The first one must be used after the deadline for gameweek 1 and before the deadline for gameweek 16, while the second one must be used after the deadline for gameweek 16.  \n  \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers for the next gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.      \nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcards do not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \n\n#### Substitutes   \nYou have to select four substitutes: Three outfield players and one goalkeeper. Please note, that the outfield players are ordered in priority from left to right, meaning your primary substitute is the one on the farthest left.   \nIf one or more players among your starters did not play in the match at all, the system will automatically substitute the non-playing player with the 1st available substitute. If your first substitute did not play, the system will move on to the next substitute and see if he played.\nImportant! The system will not put in a sub if it results in an illegal formation. It is always required to have at least three defenders, two midfielders and one forward.\nBecause we have subs, there is no safety net feature activated for this tournament. \n\n#### Budget and formations   \nYour starting budget to build a 15-player squad is 100M. Your funds can increase or decrease, as players' prices can change. You must have 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. Out of these you must field 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders, at least two midfielders, and at least 1 forward as your primary starting XI for the upcoming gameweek.    \n\nYou can choose maximum 3 players from the same club. If a player is sold to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4 (provided they are in your starting XI). However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as it will not let you store a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule.   \n\n#### There will be changing of the player prices between gameweeks. More details to follow.   \n\n####  What is new in the scoring rules?  \nNothing! If you have played a season game with us the last year, or even a daily fantasy tournament like the Weekly Monster, you already know the scoring rules!\n\nIf you do not know them, please take a look at the article in this section, called Fantasy Football rules (it is at the top of the section). The most important events are of course goals, assists and clean sheets.     \n\n#### Late registration: Until gameweek 4 \nIt will be possible to join the 25k game after the season starts, as long as the 90 minute deadline for gameweek 4 has not passed yet. Beware that a late reg team must be entered at least 90 minutes before kick-off of the first match in the gameweek, to compete in that gameweek. Similarly, all changes to such a team must be done before the 90 minute window, for the changes to take effect in the upcoming gameweek. \n\nA late registrant will get compensation points: 95% of the average score in the gameweeks he missed.",

Instead, we will use safety net for players that do not start their matches. There are 2 free transfers given per gameweek and no wildcard. The fun starts on September 6th! That is actually a deadline set in stone, as late reg is not allowed in this tournament, so start making your team(s) today so you don't miss it!\n\n#### What is the buy-in?   \nThe buy-in is €25. €21.50 of that goes towards the prize pool. \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or select a new different captain after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Monday night, for example. \n\n#### Transfers   \nThere are 2 free transfers given per gameweek and you can save up 2 more transfers. The maximum number of free transfers is therefore 4. Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. You can freely change your team as many times as you want without thinking about FTs, as GW1 has not started.\n\n#### Max entries per user   \nYou can enter a maximum of 10 teams in this tournament.   \n\n#### Wildcards   \nThere are no wildcards. \n\n#### Stacking penalty   \nThis feature is not activated for this game.\n\n#### Substitutes/Safety Net   \nThere are no subs. Instead we will use safety net, as commonly used in our daily fantasy tournaments. If your player does not start his match, he will be replaced (for that gameweek) with the next player on the list. Please refer to Safety Net section if you are not familiar with the priority list. In short, safety net will make a reasonable choice for you.\n\n#### Budget and formations   \nYour budget to build an 11-player team is 88M.

Your team cannot include more than 3 players from the same club.   \n\nYou can choose a maximum of 3 players from the same club.

With a record-breaking prize pool guarantee of £1,000,000, the Premier League season game 2021/22 is here! Manage your dream team throughout the season, as you try to maneuver to the top and the first prize of £200,000 (€230,000). You can even win more than that, as it is allowed to have several entries! It gives you 38 gameweeks of excitement, joy and of course some frustration. Join today! Gameweek 1 starts August 13th.\n\n#### What is the buy-in?   \nIt is £20. £16.60 goes towards the prize pool. For those using euro, €23 is the buy-in and €19.09 goes toward the prize pool. Regardless of how many entries the tournament gets, we will pay out £1,000,000. This is how guarantees works here at Fanteam.\n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or change your starting XI after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Friday night, for example. Please note that while there is late reg for this tournament (see below), you MUST register before the 90 minute window in order to compete in that gameweek.\n\n#### Transfers   \nFor season-long Premier League tournament there’s one free transfer allowed between each gameweek. If you don't use your free transfer one week, you can do two free transfers the following week. It is not possible to save more than 1 transfer, and the maximum amount of free transfers is therefore 2. Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. There is no limit on the number of free transfers when your team is entering the competition.\n\n#### Price changes   \nFrom Gameweek 3 onwards price changes will occur weekly through to Gameweek 37.   \n\nThere will be no price changes in Gameweek 1. The first set of price changes will occur in gameweek 2 (once matches have concluded) between 10pm BST 23rd and 10pm BST 25th August, but will only be used to manage any glaring outliers.   \n\n- Price changes will be based on player form, using our in-house xFP (expected Fantasy Points) metrics.   \n- Price changes will occur once each gameweek, in a single batch. The changes will always take place within 48 hours of the last match concluding in a gameweek.   \n- There will be a maximum of 20 price rises, and 20 player falls, per gameweek. These do not have to be balanced e.g. there could be 16 rises and only 7 falls in a gameweek.   \n- No player will drop below our price floor of £4.0m.   \n- Price rises/falls will generally be 0.1 per week, and falls will only ever be in 0.1 increments. Players can however rise by 0.2 or 0.3 in a gameweek if they hit certain criteria, but this will be rare.   \n\nThe price you see for a specific player is what it costs to buy him, and it is the amount you will receive when you sell him. There is no tax when you sell players, so the actual price of the player when you sell him is the amount you will receive.   \n\n#### Wildcards   \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers for the next gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.   \nThere are two wildcards available to you in the season-long Premier league tournament, one that can be activated until the deadline of gameweek 20, and one that can be activated after the deadline of gameweek 20.   \nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcards do not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \n\n#### Substitutes   \nYou have to select four substitutes: Three outfield players and one goalkeeper.

It can increase or decrease, as players' prices can change. You must have 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. Out of these you must field 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders, at least two midfielders, and at least 1 forward as your primary starting XI for the upcoming gameweek. Your team in the season game cannot include more than 3 players from the same club.   \n\nYou can choose maximum 3 players from the same club. If a player is sold to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4 (provided they are in your starting XI). However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as it will not let you store a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule.   \n\n####  What is new in the scoring rules?   \nCompared to last season, there are two changes you should be aware of:   \n- Points for a player's team winning/losing in the period he is on the pitch have been reduced from +/-1.0 to +/-0.3.   \n- Shots on Target are now counted. 0.4p for midfielders/forwards and 0.6p for defenders.  \n \nCheck the definition of Shot on Target and other parts of the rules in the separate section \"Fantasy Football Rules\".   \n\n#### Late registration: Until gameweek 4 \nIt will be possible to join the 1 Million game after the season starts, as long as the 90 minute deadline for gameweek 4 has not passed yet. Beware that a late reg team must be entered at least 90 minutes before kick-off of the first match in the gameweek, to compete in that gameweek. Similarly, all changes to such a team must be done before the 90 minute window, for the changes to take effect in the upcoming gameweek. \n\nA late registrant will get compensation points: 95% of the average score in the gameweeks he missed.   \n\n#### Satellites   \nThe buy-in for the PL season game is £20 (€23). However, it is possible to qualify through cheap satellites, running in many different leagues and sports. Entries to the season game won through satellites can not be exchanged for cash or sold, they have to be used by the same user who played the satellite.\n\n#### Total prizes: £1,000,000!   \nThe guarantee for the season game 2021/22 is a record-breaking £1,000,000! Please note that the guarantee means that £1,000,000 will be paid out even if the tournament does not get enough entries to pay for the guarantee.

Simply score more points in a single week than anyone else does across the entire season, and the €10k first place prize is yours! Transfer hit deductions and double gameweeks aren't included in this jackpot.   \n\nThe top ten scores across the season will be rewarded as follows:   \n\n|  Position         | Prize level      |\n| :----------- | :----------: | \n|  1st         | £10000      | \n|  2nd         | £4000      | \n|  3rd         | £3000      | \n|  4th         | £2000      | \n|  5th         | £1000      | \n|  6th         | £1000      | \n|  7th         | £1000      | \n|  8th         | £1000      | \n|  9th         | £1000      |    \n|  10th        | £1000      |    \n\nThe total amount of prizes is £25,000. Added together with freeroll prizes (£10,000), the total is £35,000. Which together with £965,000 from the season standings makes a grand total of £1,000,000.\n\n#### Additional Exclusive Freerolls    \nThere will be freerolls, only open to those participating in the PL season game. Once you have registered at least one team in the season game, you will automatically receive 9 tickets to the 9 freerolls:   \n- GW2: £2,000 GTD   \n- Each gameweek from GW3 to GW10: £1,000 GTD   \n\nThe freerolls are tournaments that last for only one gameweek and there is payout after the round is over. The format is identical to what is used in the Weekly Monsters, so if you have not played those before, this is a great opportunity to find your preferred strategy without risking any additional money!   \n\nThe freerolls are set up with a buy-in of £0.10 for technical reasons, but we promise; you will not be debited for this! All you need is the ticket.",
        "some_answer_soccer_27": "Welcome to our 2022/23 Fantasy Premier League Full Season Game, which this year is a single entry tournament! Yes, we are going One Bullet with this one, so that everybody has an equal chance to win! We think this gives it a more of a \"championship feeling\"!   \n\nWe also reduced the buy-in to €5, in order to make the game accessible to even more people around the world!    \n\n#### Buy-in    \nThe buy-in is €5 with €4.15 going towards the prize pool.   \n\n#### The guarantee: €25,000    \nThat is the minimum prize pool for this tournament. We do expect it to go over the guarantee, and if that happens, the prize pool will grow accordingly (by €4.15 per additional entry). We need 6,024 entries to cover the guarantee, but of course if we do not get that many, we will still pay out the €25,000. It would not be a guarantee otherwise!   \n\nThe first prize is guaranteed to be at least €2,500, but it will get bigger if we go over the guarantee, as it will be minimum 10% of the total prize pool. There will be prizes for top 20% of the field, based on the number of entries in the tournament.  \n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match. However, for all subsequent gameweeks, the deadline for team changes is 90 minutes before the gameweek actually starts. This means you cannot make any transfers or change your starting XI after this time. This way, you do not have to wait for line-ups from the early match to make your final choices. You can work on your team on Friday night, for example. Please note that while there is late reg for this tournament (see below), you MUST register before the 90 minute window in order to compete in that gameweek.\n\n#### Transfers: Save up unlimited (NEW)\nFor season-long Premier League tournament there’s one free transfer given between each gameweek. If you don't use your free transfer one week, you can do two free transfers the following week. In this tournament you can save up as many free transfers as you want! Additional transfers will be penalized with four minus points each. There is no limit to the number of changes you can make to your team when you are entering the competition.\n\n#### Wildcards   \nYou have two wildcards in this tournament. The first one must be used after the deadline for gameweek 1 and before the deadline for gameweek 16, while the second one must be used after the deadline for gameweek 16.  \n  \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers for the next gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek.      \nWhen you activate your wildcard you must remain within the budget for your team. Wildcards do not give you an unlimited budget. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can come back later and do more changes, as long as it is done before the gameweek deadline.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you have saved-up free transfers when you decide to use your wildcard, your saved-up transfers will be zero'ed out and you will start the following gameweek with 1 FT.   \n\n#### Substitutes   \nYou have to select four substitutes: Three outfield players and one goalkeeper. Please note, that the outfield players are ordered in priority from left to right, meaning your primary substitute is the one on the farthest left.   \nIf one or more players among your starters did not play in the match at all, the system will automatically substitute the non-playing player with the 1st available substitute. If your first substitute did not play, the system will move on to the next substitute and see if he played.\nImportant! The system will not put in a sub if it results in an illegal formation. It is always required to have at least three defenders, two midfielders and one forward.\nBecause we have subs, there is no safety net feature activated for this tournament. \n\n#### Budget and formations   \nYour starting budget to build a 15-player squad is 100M. Your funds can increase or decrease, as players' prices can change. You must have 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. Out of these you must field 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders, at least two midfielders, and at least 1 forward as your primary starting XI for the upcoming gameweek.    \n\nYou can choose maximum 3 players from the same club. If a player is sold to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4 (provided they are in your starting XI). However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as it will not let you store a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule.   \n\n#### There will be changing of the player prices between gameweeks. More details to follow.   \n\n####  What is new in the scoring rules?  \nNothing! If you have played a season game with us the last year, or even a daily fantasy tournament like the Weekly Monster, you already know the scoring rules!\n\nIf you do not know them, please take a look at the article in this section, called Fantasy Football rules (it is at the top of the section). The most important events are of course goals, assists and clean sheets.     \n\n#### Late registration: Until gameweek 4 \nIt will be possible to join the 25k game after the season starts, as long as the 90 minute deadline for gameweek 4 has not passed yet. Beware that a late reg team must be entered at least 90 minutes before kick-off of the first match in the gameweek, to compete in that gameweek. Similarly, all changes to such a team must be done before the 90 minute window, for the changes to take effect in the upcoming gameweek. \n\nA late registrant will get compensation points: 95% of the average score in the gameweeks he missed.\n\n#### About player price changes   \n- Price changes will occur once each gameweek, in a single batch.  \n- The changes will always take place within 48hrs of the last match concluding in a gameweek (with the exception of the first set of changes, see below).   \n- There will be no price changes in Gameweek 1, 2 or 3.   \n- The first set of price changes will occur once the first match of Gameweek 4 starts.   \n- From Gameweek 4 onwards price changes will occur weekly through to Gameweek 37.   \n- Price changes will be based on player form, using our in-house xFP (expected Fantasy Points) metrics. We will not be providing the full method used here, but be assured it will remain consistent and has been thoroughly tested prior to the season getting underway.   \n- There will be a maximum of 20 price rises, and 20 player falls, per gameweek. These do not have to be balanced e.g. there could be 16 rises and only 7 falls in a gameweek.   \n- No player will drop below our price floor of £4.0m.   \n- Price rises / falls will generally be 0.1 per week, and falls will only ever be in 0.1 increments. Players can however rise by 0.2 or 0.3 in a gameweek if they hit certain criteria, but this will be rare.   \n- Players who have moved in price will be posted on our Discord and Twitter accounts each gameweek.",

Many users got tired of seeing 50 or 100 identical teams from some participants, pushing other users down the prize list. This year we have decided to set the max number of entries at 10, which is a radical change, and something we think many of our customers will welcome. It does come with a cost however, as the prize pool will be smaller than it otherwise would be.  But we think many people will be happy to not have to see those enormous \"trains\". The decision will help us achieve our goal of making the fantasy competitions more beginner-friendly.\n\n#### Deadline for changes   \nFor the first gameweek, you can make changes to your team until the start of the first match.

        "some_answer_deposite_0": "SKRILL   \n– A very popular digital wallet. Deposits and withdrawals work well. They have a physical, prepaid Mastercard that is linked to the account, so it will be easy to spend your winnings! There is a prepaid, virtual Mastercard as well. Be aware that it may be difficult to load your Skrill account with a bank card that is blocked for gambling transactions. The solution is to load your Skrill account from a different source, for example Paysafecard.  \n\nPAYSAFECARD \n– A prepaid voucher that is extremely easy to use. You need to physically go to a location where Paysafecard is sold, but once you have the voucher, it takes 30 seconds to make the deposit. You do not have to make an account with Paysafecard to do it. But if you do make an account, you can withdraw money to it, and even get a physical, prepaid Mastercard.  \n\nBANK CARD \n– Traditionally the easiest method of deposit, but there are some restrictions put in place by the banks, depending on which country the card is issued from. Some cards work, others do not. In general, if your debit card does not work for deposits to Fanteam, your bank probably has blocked it for gambling purposes and it is not much you (or we) can do to change that. Fortunately, there are many other ways to deposit, even with your bank card!\nCredit cards are not accepted on Fanteam website for customers registered from the UK, including credit card payments made through e-wallets.\n\nPAYPAL \n– A popular digital wallet that is very easy to get started with. Only an email address and password is required! Pay Pal is practical as an intermediary as well. You actually do not even have to have a Pay Pal account to do a transfer between a source of payment (for example bank cards) and Fanteam.  \n\nECOPAYZ \n– A digital wallet which has a wide variety of funding options. Be aware that if you link a bank card that does not allow gambling transactions to your Ecopayz account, you will not be able to use the account for gambling. To avoid this problem, you can use the Zestpay option to fund your Ecopayz account. It is easier than it sounds! Just click on Zestpay and follow the directions, it takes only a minute. Ecopayz also offers a physical, contactless Mastercard that is linked to your account, so you can easily make withdrawals in ATM's or use your balance for shopping.   \n  \nTRUSTLY \n– It works for deposits and withdrawals. Trustly provides the ability to make online payments directly from your bank account in a secure way. In addition to allowing for quick and easy payments, no sign-up or software installation is required. \n\nNETELLER \n– A digital wallet that has been around since the beginning of time. Deposits and withdrawals work well. They have both physical and virtual Mastercards, all prepaid so there is no credit check.  \n\nKLARNA-SOFORT  \n– Klarna (or SOFORT) is an online banking payment service which enables you to use e-banking to make quick and secure bank transfers. It works for deposits and withdrawals  \n\n\n(Not all options are available in all locations).\n\nPlease note: \n- The Payer ID is to be used in order to ensure that funds are properly credited to the consumer and paid into the account from which the original payment to the merchant was received.   \n- We do not permit a player to use multiple PayPal accounts or any other payment provider multiple accounts (multiple Payer IDs) to fund a single Fanteam account.",

        "some_answer_fantasy_10": "![Baseball players](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg.net/support-pages/sgn-baseballmini.jpg){.right .ml-s .m-s}   \nThere are two formats for daily fantasy baseball multi-match.\n\nClassic: 10 active players and no subs. Every entry must have pitchers (2), catcher (1), 1st base (1), 2nd base (1), short stop (1), 3rd base (1), outfielders (3). Each player has a price and there is a salary cap.\n\nEasyEight: This is our newest baseball format. It is designed to be easier to use than classic. 8 active players and no subs. Here we have only three positions: Pitcher (1), infielder (4), and outfielder (3). Each player has a price and there is a salary cap.\n\nThere is no captain in these formats. The maximum number of hitters from any team is 5. An entry must include players from at least 2 baseball games. An entry can be changed at any time as long as the deadline has not passed. Position eligibility is decided at our discretion.\n\n#### Safety net in baseball and postponed matches (NEW)   \nBaseball is a sport that is under constant threat of rain and thunderstorms, so we are happy to announce that we now have a safety net for this sport!   \nIf you have a player that did not get to play, you will now get a replacement. The system will look for:   \n1. A player from the same position (this is a 100% requirement).   \n2. A player from the same club, but if one is not available (as would be the case with a postponement) it will look for a replacement from any other club.   \n3. The system will choose the player that is closest to the missing player's price, but the price cannot be higher than the missing player's price.   \nNote: Safety net will kick into action if a hitter has not taken part in the match during the three first innings. For a pitcher, he will be replaced if he does not start the match.   \n\n#### Tiebreaker Rules when two or more replacement players cost the same   \n1. Safety Net will pick the player with the most ‘FORM’ points. ‘FORM’ is based on a player's points average from his/her last 5 games.   \n2. If the players have the same ‘FORM’ points, then Safety Net will pick the player with the most fantasy ‘POINTS’ for the whole season.   \n3. If the players share the same seasonal ‘POINTS', Safety Net will pick the player by alphabetical order.   \n  \n**Safety Net can be used in two situations: to replace an individual player in the case they don’t start a match, or to replace all the players from teams whose match got postponed.**   \n\nHowever, the safety net will not be used in these two cases:   \n1. If 50% or more of the matches in the tournament are postponed, or   \n2. If there are less than 3 matches to pick replacements from   \nIn these cases, the tournament will be cancelled, and the buy-ins will be returned to the players.     \n\n#### Postponed matches vs interrupted matches   \nWith 'postponed matches' we mean matches that did not start on the day they were originally scheduled to play. If the match is played the next day, the results from this match will not affect the tournament. The match will still have status as 'postponed' and be subject to replacements from Safety Net.\nMatches that are postponed before the tournaments start will be treated equal to matches that are postponed after the tournament starts. Safety Net will aim to replace players from both. Alternatively, you can replace the players yourself if you are aware of the postponement before the tournament starts.   \n\nIn cases where a match has already started and gets interrupted, players who have been awarded points for events in them will keep the points. Normally, these matches get continued in the following day, therefore we will wait for interrupted matches to be completed. If the match has not been completed 36 hours after the original start time, we will wait no further, and players will only get the points they gained so far in the match.\n\n#### Point system – Fantasy Baseball   \nPoints are awarded for baseball players continuously, based on match events described in live feeds from the stat provider FantasyData, during and up until right after each match. The points are given based on the player’s performance on the field, which can generate both positive and negative values.\n\nThe stats will be verified directly after the match to ensure the best quality possible before finalizing the points. Once the result is verified, it is official and can’t be changed at a later date due to any type of official game ruling.\n\n\n#### Points table – Fantasy Baseball   \nPitchers only acquire points when pitching and hitters only acquire points when batting.\n\n\n   |PITCHING | Points | \n   |: ------------|-------------- |\n   | Winning pitcher* | 4 points  |\n   | Earned run | -2 points |\n   | Strikeout | 2 points |\n   | Innings pitched ** | 2.25 points |\n   | Hit against | -0.6 points |\n   | Base on balls / Walk against   | -0.6 points |\n   | Hit batter | -0.6 points |\n   | Complete game  | 2.5 points  |\n   | Complete game shut out  | 2.5 points | \n\n*\"Winning pitcher\" is by definition awarded to a pitcher from the winning team. The Official Scorer of the game decides who will get the award, based on the official rules on this award by Major League Baseball. We will adhere to the decision by the Official Scorer, which is publicized on MLB.com.       \n  \n** A full inning is worth 2.25p, but the pitcher can also get points for an uncomplete inning. As there are 3 outs per inning for a pitcher, we give 0.75p per hitter who is out.\n\n  \n   |HITTING | Points | \n   |: ------------|-------------- |\n   | Single  | 3 points  |\n   | Double | 5 points |\n   | Triple | 8 points |\n   | Home run | 10 points |\n   | RBI | 1.5 points |\n   | Run scored   | 1.5 points |\n   | Base on balls /Walk | 2.5 points |\n   | Stolen base | 4 points  |\n   | Hit by pitch | 2.5 points |\n   | Caught stealing | -3 points |\n   | Strikeout | -1 points |",

Quad: a player kills 4 enemies in a round.   \nc. Ace - a player kills 5 enemies in a round.   \nPoints for these events are added on top of Enemy kills. Quad and Ace points cannot be awarded in the same round - it can either be Quad or Ace. If a player kills all 5 enemies in 1 round, there is a small chance that he still loses the round, but it is still an ace in this case.\n\n3.   \na. Assist: A player deals at least 41 damage and the enemy dies afterwards in any way. There can only be one Assist per Kill, so if 2 players dealt the same amount of damage, the first one to deal the damage gets the Assist.   \nb. Flash assist: Player A throws a flashbang grenade and blinds an enemy. Player B kills the enemy while he is blind. Player A then gets a Flash assist.\n\n4. 1v1 Clutch: The player receiving points for this is the last man alive of his team. To get the points he must win the round. It does not matter if he kills the enemy, or wins through defusing/exploding the bomb. In this scenario he is up against 1 enemy.\n\n5. Bomb Planted: Every player of the team that is still alive will get the points for planting the bomb.\n\n6. Bomb Defused: Every player of the team that is still alive will get the points for defusing the bomb.\n\n7. The NRW is the sum of rounds a team has won minus the number of rounds the team lost. Every player on the team will be awarded 1 point per NRW. If a team wins with scores of 16-8 and 16-10, the NRW is 8+6 = 14 and 14 points are awarded to each team player.\n\n8. Compensation points will be awarded to players that do not play all maps. For each full map that a player does not play, he will be given the average of points that his teammates earned in that map. If his teammates win any bonus, the subbed out player will get a bonus too. If the player only plays part of a map, he will not be getting compensation points for that map.\n\n9. If a player who is expected to play in a match, gets replaced before the match starts, he will be substituted by the new player.

Drivers will score points on each one of the events, and their total points are the sum of the points they gathered in both.\n\n#### Points table - Qualifying\n\n|  Happening     | Points    | Notes     |\n| :----------- | :----------: | --------: |\n|  1st place         | 20.0 points      |           | \n|  2nd place         | 16.5 points      |           |\n|  3rd place         | 15.0 points      |           |\n|  4th place         | 13.5 points      |           | \n|  5th place         | 12.5 points      |           | \n|  6th place         | 11.5 points      |           | \n|  7th place         | 10.2 points      |           | \n|  8th place         |  9.5 points      |           | \n|  9th place         |  8.5 points      |           | \n|  10th place         | 7.5 points      |           | \n|  11th - 20th place         | 5 points - 0.5 point      | 0.5 point per position          | \n|  Retire / Not finish / Disqualify         | - 2.5 points      |           | \n|  Performance against teammate         | +/- 0.2 points per place difference      |  Min. -1 points ; Max. +1 points - If this driver didn’t finish: 0p - If only this driver finished: +1p |   \n\nPoints given from Qualifying, Sprint Race and Main Race are determined by the official results.\nAny grid penalties and/or time penalties given as a result of an incident during qualifying (or free practice) will therefore not apply to the qualifying result, even if the driver will start the race in a different position from his qualifying result.   \n\n\n#### Points table - Sprint   \n\n|  Happening     | Points    | Notes     |\n| :----------- | :----------: | --------: |\n|  1st place       | 20.0 points      |           | \n|  2nd place         | 16.5 points      |           |\n|  3rd place         | 15.0 points      |           |\n|  4th place         | 13.5 points      |           | \n|  5th place         | 12.5 points      |           | \n|  6th place         | 11.5 points      |           | \n|  7th place         | 10.5 points      |           | \n|  8th place         | 9.5 points      |           | \n|  9th place         | 8.5 points      |           | \n|  10th place         | 7.5 points      |           | \n|  11th - 20th place         | 5.0 points - 0.5 point      | 0.5 point per position          | \n|  Retire / Not finish / Disqualify         | - 2.5 points      |           | \n|  Performance against teammate         | +/- 0.2 points per place difference      |  Min. -1 points ; Max. +1 points - If this driver didn’t finish: 0p - If only this driver finished: +1p         | \n|  Finish compared to starting position         | +/- 0.10 points per place difference      | If driver doesn’t finish, he gets 0p          | \n|  Fastest lap bonus         | 1.0 points      |           |\n|  Driver of the Day         | 0.5 point     |           |\n|  Win + Fastest lap bonus         | 0.5 point     |           |\n\n\n#### Points table - Race   \n\n|  Happening     | Points    | Notes     |\n| :----------- | :----------: | --------: |\n|  1st place       | 40 points      |           | \n|  2nd place         | 33 points      |           |\n|  3rd place         | 30 points      |           |\n|  4th place         | 27 points      |           | \n|  5th place         | 25 points      |           | \n|  6th place         | 23 points      |           | \n|  7th place         | 21 points      |           | \n|  8th place         | 19 points      |           | \n|  9th place         | 17 points      |           | \n|  10th place         | 15 points      |           | \n|  11th - 20th place         | 10 points - 1 point      | 1 point per position          | \n|  Retire / Not finish / Disqualify         | - 5 points      |           | \n|  Performance against teammate         | +/- 0.4 points per place difference      |  Min. -2 points ; Max. +2 points - If this driver didn’t finish: 0p - If only this driver finished: +2p         | \n|  Finish compared to starting position         | +/- 0.20 points per place difference      | If driver doesn’t finish, he gets 0p          | \n|  Fastest lap bonus         | 2 points      |           |\n|  Driver of the Day         | 1 point     |           |\n|  Win + Fastest lap bonus         | 1 point     |           |\n\n#### Definitions - Fantasy Formula   \n\n- Race Weekend = Full race weekend (Qualifying + Sprint + Race)\n- Sprint = Short race session held on Saturday in a few special Race Weekends (UK, Italy & Abu Dhabi for 2021). Starting grid for the Sprint is determined by the Qualifying results. The finish positions of the Sprint event will determine the starting grid for the Race\n- Qualifying = Session held on Saturday before the Race. Qualifying order determines the starting position of drivers in the Race. This event includes all three qualifying stages, Q1, Q2 and Q3, and does not include Free Practices.\n- Race = Final session of the Race Weekend. Held on Sunday and determines the final ranking.   \n\n- DNF = Did not finish the session, due to a crash, disqualification, mechanical failure, not starting the race, or any other reason, according to the official Results.\n- Qualifying position = The position of the driver in the official Qualifying Results.\n- Starting grid position = The position of the driver before the start of the race. This might be different from the Qualifying position, due to penalties enforced by racing officials between the Qualifying and the Race.\n- Race finish position = The position of the driver in the official Race Results.   \n\n- Fastest lap = Awarded to the driver who made the best individual lap during the Race.\n- Driver of the Day = Awarded to the driver who received the most votes from the audience during the Race. Announced at the end of the TV broadcast.   \n\n#### Special circumstances and exceptions     \n\nIn Formula racing, penalties may be imposed on drivers after the race has finished. In some cases penalties may be decided several days later.   \n- For Daily Fantasy tournaments, we will wait 30 minutes for late penalties to be included. After this time, the DFS result will be final.   \n- For multi-gameweek/season style fantasy tournaments, we will wait 48 hours for late penalties to be included. After this time, the result of the gameweek in such a tournament will be final.   \n\nIf any of the sessions (Qualifying, Sprint or Race) are suspended for any reason, and no official results are published, then the tournament will be canceled and all players will receive their buy-ins back. (only  for DFS)   \nIf a driver is replaced by his reserve for any reason and doesn’t compete in the Qualifying and/or the Race, then the points scored by the reserve driver will count for the main driver.",
        "some_answer_fantasy_15": "![Upload feature](https://fantasy.assets.scoutgg.net/support-pages/sgn-csv-import430.jpg){.right .ml-s .m-s}   \nThis feature lets you enter teams into our fantasy tournaments by uploading a file. It is a helpful tool for those who plan to have multiple entries in a tournament and have some kind of program that structures the set up for them. It is possible to use spreadsheets, like Excel for this purpose. It is also possible to develop software in any programming language to utilize the feature.    \n\n**NEW: You can now access this feature in two ways:**   \n- Open a tournament, click on the three-dot menu next to the autocomplete button, and choose \"Upload team(s) from file\"   \n- If you already have entries in the tournament, go to \"My entries\" (must be logged in), choose the tournament, and edit one of your teams. Then the feature will be available from the three-dot menu   \n\nNOTE: It does not matter which of these ways you access the feature.   \n\nThe process of uploading the file is easy to understand, and the system will accept a large number of entries in a few seconds. We would like to stress that this feature is in beta, so please be a bit careful if you are not comfortable with trusting it with big money, and also please report any problems to support.  \n\n#### Can I edit already entered teams with a new CSV file? (NEW)   \nYES! Now you can! We kept the file format unchanged, as to not cause any problems for current users of the feature. How to edit your teams:   \n- Create a new file with your new, preferred line-ups. Include all teams, the ones you don't want to edit too!   \n- The new file must have the same number of entries as you already have in the tournament, or more   \n- If that is the case, the system will ask you if you want to replace existing teams or simply add more teams   \n- Choose the \"replace\" option and the system will change all your old teams!   \n\nThere is no limit as to how many times you can edit your teams.   \nNote: If you want to both replace your existing teams and add more teams, you can do this with one single file. For this to happen, the new file must obviously contains more teams than you already have in the tournament. Choose the \"replace\" option, and old teams will be corrected, while also new ones will be added. No problem!  \n\n#### Does it work for both season games and daily fantasy?   \nFor a standard upload of entries, it works for all types of tournaments. While it will be mostly used for daily fantasy tournaments, you can indeed use it for seasonal games with substitutes. At the end of this article, there is a paragraph about its use for season games. Please note however, that the new editing option does not work for tournaments with more than one gameweek (season games).    \n \n#### How does it work?   \n1. Open the tournament you are interested in\n2. Look for the download symbol at the bottom of the player list. If you click it, you will get a file with player names, player IDs, prices, positions, statuses for the tournament.\n3. The system is using player IDs as identificator, not player names.\n4. For uploading a file with entries, go to the triple-dot menu on the right side. Choose ‘Upload team(s) from file’. \n5. The system will check your file and let you know If there are any problems. You will be required to confirm, before any teams are entered into the tournament.  \n\n#### The file format   \nThe system will accept a text file that looks like this, where each line describes an entry:   \n49993,25428,217031,123999,122580,218181,217031,25428   \n49993,25428,217031,123999,122580,218181,123999,25428   \n49993,25428,217031,123999,122580,218181,122580,25428   \nThis example file has three entries for tournament ID 49993. Each entry has 5 players on the field + captain + vice captain.\n\nIn general, this is the format:   \nTournamentID,player1ID,player2ID,…playerxID,captainID,vicecaptainID   \nwhere ‘x’ is the number of players used in the actual tournament format. If there is no vice captain in the format, it will look like this:   \nTournamentID, player1ID, player2ID,…playerxID, captainID \n\nIt should work for all tournaments. The system checks what kind of tournament it is. Do we require 7 players? Do we have vice captain? Then it looks for the appropriate number of IDs in the file. If there are other checks relevant to this tournament, for example a maximum budget or a minimum number of players for a given position, the system will of course check for this and not allow entries that violates the rules.   \nThings to bear in mind:   \n- Fields are separated by comma, not semi colon\n- There should be no whitespaces after comma\n- There should be no comma at the end of a line\n- There should be no newline or whitespace after the last entry   \nThere is no limit as to how many entries you can have in a file. But some tournaments may have a limit as to how many entries you are allowed to have in total (entered manually + by file).\n\n#### Season games with substitutes   \n\nFor all tournaments with substitutes, you need to add the subs at the end of the line in the file. So for the 1M game, your file would have this format:   \nTournamentID,player1ID,player2ID,…player11ID,captainID,vicecaptainID,sub1ID,sub2ID,sub3ID,sub4ID   \n\nPlease note: Identical teams in the same tournament will no longer be linked. When making changes you will have to make the change for each one.",
        "some_answer_fantasy_16": "#### The full squad format   \nThe standard full squad cricket format includes 11 players and no subs. It is used for test matches only.  \nWicket keeper: 1   \nBatsmen: 3-5   \nAll-rounder: 1-3   \nBowler: 3-5   \nOne player must be selected as captain, and will earn double points. You can pick maximum 7 players from one side.   \nPosition eligibility is decided at our discretion. \n\n#### The Universal 6 format   \nWe are introducing a new format for fantasy tournaments, designed to be possible to use in all sports, easily recognizable for the user when he moves from one sport to another. It is especially useful for when you have a small number of matches. In cricket, we use this format for T20s and ODIs.  \n\n- Classic fantasy with a budget.\n- 6 players, pick from any position.\n- The captain will receive 1.50 x his points, but also he will cost 1.50 x the price.\n- The vice captain will receive 1.20 x his points, but also he will cost 1.20 x the price.   \n  \n#### Postponed and rescheduled fixtures   \n\nDaily fantasy cricket is typically played as one-match tournaments. If the match is postponed and re-scheduled to a starting time that is within 36 hours of the original starting time, we will wait for that result. If the match is not played within 36 hours, the tournament is cancelled and players get their buy-ins back.\n   \n**Rain delay and rain interruption rules for 50 over and T20 cricket formats**   \nRain Delay in single match - If a match is a wash out and the game can’t be completed then the contest will be cancelled and money returned.   \nIf a game is delayed or interrupted but still reaches its minimum overs for the match to be deemed a result then the contest results will stand.   \nRain Delay in multi match - If a game is delayed or interrupted it will count towards the score of the contest as long as the match reaches its minimum overs for the match to be deemed a result.   \nIf a match in the contest is a complete wash-out and/or can't be completed the contest will be cancelled and money returned.   \n\nTest match contest results will stand if there has been any play as there is no minimum over rate for the match to result in a draw. Money will be returned if no play has taken place.\n\n#### Points scoring system   \n\nPoints are awarded for players continuously, based on match events described in live feeds from the stat provider, during and up until right after each match. The points are given based on the player’s performance on the field, which can generate both positive and negative values.\nThe stats will be verified directly after the match to ensure the best quality possible before finalizing the points.\n\n#### Points table   \n\n   |Events | T20 | ODI | TEST| \n   |: ------------|-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |\n   | Was in starting 11 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 |\n   | Run | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n   | Boundary | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n   | Six | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |\n   | Half-century | 4.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 |\n   | Century | 8.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 |\n   | Dismissal for a Duck (BM, WK, AR) | -2.0 | -3.0 | -4.0 |\n   | Wicket | 10.0 | 12.0 | 8.0 |\n   | 4 Wicket Haul Bonus | 4.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 |\n   | 5 Wicket Haul Bonus | 5.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 |\n   | Maiden Over | 4.0 | 2.0 | N/A |\n   | Catch | 4.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 |\n   | Stumping/Run-out | 6.0 | 6.0 | 6.0 |\n   | Run-out (catcher) | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 |\n   | Run-out (thrower) | 4.0 | 4.0 | 4.0 |   \n      \n     \n    \n   |Economy rate | T20 | ODI | TEST| \n   |: ----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |\n   | Less than 4 (T20)/Less than 2.5 (ODI) | 3.0 | 3.0 | N/A |\n   | At least 4, Less than 5 (T20)/At least 2.5, Less than 3.5 (ODI) | 2.0 | 2.0 | N/A |\n   | At least 5, At most 6 (T20)/At least 3.5, At most 4.5 (ODI) | 1.0 | 1.0 | N/A |\n   | At least 9, At most 10 (T20)/At least 7, At most 8 (ODI) | -1.0 | -1.0 | N/A |\n   | More than 10, At most 11 (T20)/More than 8, At most 9 (ODI) | -2.0 | -2.0 | N/A |\n   | More than 11 (T20)/More than 9 (ODI) | -3.0 | -3.0 | N/A |   \n    \n    \n    \n\n   |Strike rate | T20 | ODI | TEST| \n   |: ----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |\n   | At least 60, At most 70 (T20)/At least 50, At most 60 (ODI) | -1.0 | -1.0 | N/A |\n   | At least 50, Less than 60 (T20)/At least 40, Less than 50 (ODI) | -2.0 | -2.0 | N/A |\n   | Less than 50 (T20)/Less than 40 (ODI) | -3.0 | -3.0 | N/A |   \n\nSUPER OVER   \nWe do not consider the Super Over in Fantasy Cricket as runs/wickets scored by the players are not counted in the official records.   \n\nMAN OF THE MATCH   \nThere are no points to be earned for Man of the Match.  \n \nPLAYER SENT OFF   \nAny player who is sent off by the umpires for serious misconduct regulated by the ICC Playing Conditions for International Matches will score and retain points for his contribution during his time on the field.

You can own only one or both drivers from any team. There are no captains. Each race weekend constitute one gameweek. We count points for not only the race itself, but qualifiers too. See details on scoring in general fantasy formula rules.\n\n#### Prizepool   \nThe guaranteed prizepool is €20,000. This will be paid out even if the number of entries is lower than expected. If the number of entries is higher than required in order to reach the guarantee, the prize pool will of course be increased correspondingly.\n\n#### The buy-in   \nIt costs €20 per entry in the tournament.

It is, however possible to make additional transfers in exchange for a points penalty of -6.    \n\n#### Replacement drivers   \nIf a driver doesn’t race, he’ll be auto-replaced by his real-life reserve. There is no safety net, as is known from other sports.\n\n#### Prizes\nWe guarantee the prize pool to be at least €20,000. If we reach the number required to fill the guarantee, each additional entry will contribute to the prize pool, which will then go above €20,000. To find out specifically what the first prize will be, please look in the prize section of the in-game rules. Prize distribution will be normal, to 20% of the field.    \n\n#### Wildcards   \nThere are two wildcards. One that must be used for gameweeks 2-11 and one that must be used for GW 12-23.

If you are in doubt, please look them up, under “Fantasy Formula Rules”. Please note that fantasy formula scoring has been updated for this season. Now, Qualifying gives fewer points than the Race (around half), so the Race is the main event of the weekend.\n\n#### Sprint Qualifying   \nThis season, a new concept of Sprint Qualifying will be introduced to three race weekends in the calendar. Sprint Qualifying will count for the season game. The scoring will be similar to the Race, but will give around half of the points compared to the Race. The first Sprint Qualifying is scheduled for the Great Britain weekend in July. Please check back closer to that date for the detailed Sprint Qualifying rules.",

Used for example in Fantasy Formula, there will be drivers with prices, and a budget as usual, but drivers will be grouped into categories. The grouping is based on the drivers' strength compared to other drivers in the tournament. The drivers most likely to score many fantasy points will be in Tier 1, and so on.\n\nCategories work the same way positions like defender, midfield and forward work in football.

        "some_answer_fantasy_22": "From time to time, we are organizing Profit Leaderboards for various sports & events, awarding special prizes to the winners.    \n\n#### What is a Profit Leaderboard?    \nA Profit Leaderboard is a short-term competition that is based on results from a set of paid contests from our Daily Fantasy games. For every fantasy contest that counts for the Leaderboard, the top users accumulate points based on the profit they made in that contest. In the end, the top users on the Total Points standings win prizes. See the section ‘How does the scoring work?’ to get more details.   \n\n#### How do I enter a Leaderboard?   \nYou don’t need to do anything to join the Leaderboard. If you play in any of the participating contests, you will automatically see your name on the standings and are eligible to win prizes.   \n\n#### Where can I find the Leaderboards?    \nWhen a Leaderboard is active, a “Leaderboard” tab will appear on the top menu, under the “Games” tab. Clicking on that option you will see the Leaderboard page, where you can read all the active Leaderboards, read the details of each one and explore the latest standings.   \n\n#### What are the prizes? Where do they come from?   \nFor every Leaderboard that we run, a list of prizes is announced for the winners.   \nThe prizes can be monetary (cash, tournament tickets, free bets, etc.) or non-monetary (trips, game consoles, football shirts, etc.).   \nPrizes are added on top of our tournaments at our cost - no money is held from the prize pools of the contests towards the Leaderboards.   \n\n#### How long does a Leaderboard last?   \nLeaderboards generally last for a few days or weeks. Exact lengths vary based on each event - you can find details about every event under the Details section on the Leaderboard page.   \n\n#### How does the scoring work?   \nScoring is based on the net profit each user got at the end of each contest that is part of the leaderboard. The user who earned the biggest net profit earns the 1st place points, the runner up earns the 2nd place points, etc.   \nNet profit is calculated as follows: Total Returns (Winnings) minus Total cost of Buy-Ins.   \nThe top 30 users from each contest earn points, based on the table below:   \n\n   |Rank    | Points  | \n   |: ------|-------- |\n   |  1     |   1000  |\n   |  2     |    750  |\n   |  3     |    600  |\n   |  4     |    500  |\n   |  5     |    425  |\n   |  6     |    360  |\n   |  7     |    300  |\n   |  8     |    250  |\n   |  9     |    210  |\n   | 10     |    175  |\n   | 11     |    140  |\n   | 12     |    100  |\n   | 13-14  |     90  |\n   | 15-16  |     80  |\n   | 17-20  |     70  |\n   | 21-25  |     60  |\n   | 26-30  |     50  |\n \nThe points earned from each contest (Round) are summed up to the Total Points shown on the Overall leaderboard.   \n\n#### Tie-breakers for round standings   \nIn case of ties in single round net profit, the round’s standings are calculated based on the following rules:   \n1) Highest net profit (or lowest net loss)   \n2) Highest amount of teams entered in the contest   \n3) Highest rank finish of an individual team (only the top team of each user is considered)    \nEarliest entry time in the contest (only the team entered earliest counts)   \n\n#### Tie-breakers for overall rankings    \nIn case of ties in the overall rankings of the Leaderboard, the final results are calculated based on the following rules:   \n1) Highest profit in the last Gameweek   \n2) Highest amount of entries in the last Gameweek   \n3) Highest rank finish in the last Gameweek   \n\nNote: These tie-breaker rules will come into effect starting with our Premier League Leaderboard on April 16th, 2021.

        "some_answer_fantasy_26": "The rake level in a tournament is in most cases determined by the number of entries required to meet guarantee of the tournament. Once a tournament has been created, the rake percentage is fixed and will not be changed. \n\nExample of rake calculation: If a tournament has a buy-in of 10€ and has 100 entries, the prize pool is 1000€ before rake is deducted. If the rake is 11%, then 1000 x 0.11 = 110€ is taken out of the prize pool and 890€ remains for player prizes. Note: Usually there is a guaranteed prize pool. If taking out rake means that the prize pool drops below the guarantee, then we will only take as much rake as is possible without cutting into the guarantee.

Late registrants will get compensation points equal to 95% of the average score in the Gameweeks they missed.   \n\n#### What is the first prize?   \nThe winner will get €2,000.  \n    \n#### Is there a maximum number of entries I can have in the tournament?   \nYes, you can enter up to 10 entries.   \n\n#### Will prices for drivers/constructors change during the tournament?   \nYes, prices will change in the week leading up to each Race Weekend. The most they can increase/decrease in one Gameweek is +/- 0.5M.   \n\n#### Can I cancel a transfer?   \nUnfortunately, it is not possible to reverse a transfer.   \n\n#### Guaranteed prize pool: €20,000!   \nWe guarantee to pay out this amount, regardless of the number of entries. The maximum number of entries in this tournament is 1204, so the prize pool can't be over 20,000€.   \n\n#### Driver scoring   \nFor the scoring of drivers, please go to the general Fantasy Formula 1 rules section.   \n\n#### Constructor scoring   \n\n| Qualification & Sprint              |      |\n|-------------------------------------|------|\n| 1st place                           |  2.5 |\n| 2nd place                           |  2.0 |\n| 3rd place                           |  1.5 |\n| 4th place                           |  1.0 |\n| 5th place                           |  0.5 |\n| Car finished                        |  1.0 |\n| Penalty                             | -1.0 | \n   \n.     \n\n| Race                                |      |\n|-------------------------------------|------|\n| Fastest pitstop                     |  2.0 |\n| 1st place                           |  5.0 |\n| 2nd place                           |  4.0 |\n| 3rd place                           |  3.0 |\n| 4th place                           |  2.0 |\n| 5th place                           |  1.0 |\n| Car finished                        |  2.0 |\n| Penalty                             | -1.0 |\n   \n   \n#### Additional notes on constructor scoring    \n\n1. Constructors rankings are derived from the results of their drivers. For each constructor, the sum of the seats of the two cars is calculated. Then, the manufacturer with the lowest sum (total position) receives Rank 1, the second the Rank 2, and so on. For drivers who do not finish, for this calculation we consider 20th as the finish position. In case of a tie between the two teams, the team with the driver who finished higher prevails.  \n \n2. As cars that finished we count the number of cars of this group that got final ranking (not DNF). This number can be 0, 1 or 2.   \n\n3. Any penalties that each of the two drivers of the constructor receive, count negatively for their constructors. As penalties we consider the penalties imposed on cars for various offenses, such as illegal overtaking, etc. All penalties will be considered equal, with each penalty awarded to a team counting for -1 point. These penalties also include any penalties resulting from Free Practice or for components changes. It is noted that we will calculate only the official penalties written in the official reports and are imposed in racing events (lost starting positions, -5 seconds, starting from the pit lane, etc.). Any penalties that are not applied on racing events will be ignored (financial fines, license points, etc.).",
        "some_answer_fantasy_37": "Now you can play Tour de France season fantasy! The biggest cycling tour on the planet starts July 1st, so let's begin planning which riders to pick for the team! Manage your team through 21 stages, with 25 transfers at your disposal. It is the first time we run this game at Fanteam, so we have set the guarantees moderately (€2,000 for the 20€ buy-in), but if the interest is big, the prize pools will of course grow accordingly, above the guarantees. \n\nTournament deadline: July 1st, at 16:00 CET\nNOTE: There is no late registration!\n\n#### Format   \nYour team:   \n- 1 Team director   \n- 1 Time trial specialist   \n- 3 Support riders   \n- 2 Team captains   \n- 2 Young riders   \n- 2 Climbers   \n- 2 Sprinters   \n\nSo 12 riders in total + one team director. Maximum 3 riders from a team (including team director).\n\n#### Buy-ins, guarantees and rake   \nIn the €3, the prize pool is guaranteed to be at least €500.   \nIn the €20, the prize pool is guaranteed to be at least €2,000.   \n\nFrom each entry we take 17% rake. So, in the €3 buy-in tournament, €2.49 goes towards the prize pool. In the €20 buy-in tournament, €16.60 goes towards the prize pool.  \n\nSo, even if we get very few entries, the payout will always be guaranteed.   \nHowever, the prize pools can get bigger. For the high buy-in, 2000/16.60 = 120.4. So if we get more than 120 entries, the prize pool will start growing (by 16.60 per additional entry).   \n\nThe maximum number of entries per user is 10.   \n\n#### Transfers   \nNumber of transfers: You have 25 in total, which you can use at any time in the race.   \nAdditional transfers for penalty points: None.   \n\nTransfers must be made before the stage has begun. Transfers made while the stage is on-going will take effect when next stage starts.   \n\nYou can make an unlimited number of transfers before the tournament starts.   \n\n#### Budget and prices   \nThere is a budget and you can not buy more expensive riders than the budget allows.  \nRider prices will not vary during the tournament.   \n\n#### Scoring for riders   \nRiders will get points for stages they perform well in. Their scores for each stage will be multiplied, depending on which type of rider they are:   \n\n- Team captains 5x\n- Climbers, sprinters, support riders, time trial specialists: 4x\n- Young riders: 3x\n\nMultiplication will apply to all scoring rules mentioned below.\n\n#### Additional events that results in fantasy points      \nTeam mate winning the stage - 10p   \nMost aggressive rider on the stage - 25p   \nRider takes the yellow jersey - 20p   \nRider takes the green jersey - 20p   \nRider takes the polka dot jersey - 20p   \nRider takes the white jersey - 20p   \n\nNOTE: Points are given whenever a rider is awarded a jersey after a stage, when he did not have it during the stage. Points are not given for defending a jersey. Also, a rider that is awarded more than one jersey after a stage can only get points for one of the jerseys.   \n\n#### Placements during the stages         \n\n   | Place  | Finish | Cat HC | Cat 1 | cat 2 | Cat 3 | Cat 4 | Sprint | \n   |: ------------|-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |-------------- |\n   |   1st  |  100   |   60   |   30  |   15  |    6  |    3  |    20  |\n   |   2nd  |   80   |   45   |   24  |    9  |    3  |       |    17  |\n   |   3rd  |   60   |   36   |   18  |    6  |       |       |    15  |\n   |   4th  |   50   |   30   |   12  |    3  |       |       |    13  |\n   |   5th  |   40   |   24   |    6  |       |       |       |    11  |\n   |   6th  |   36   |   18   |    3  |       |       |       |    10  |\n   |   7th  |   32   |   12   |       |       |       |       |     9  |\n   |   8th  |   28   |    6   |       |       |       |       |     8  |\n   |   9th  |   24   |        |       |       |       |       |     7  |\n   |  10th  |   21   |        |       |       |       |       |     6  |\n   |  11th  |   18   |        |       |       |       |       |     5  |\n   |  12th  |   15   |        |       |       |       |       |     4  |\n   |  13th  |   12   |        |       |       |       |       |     3  |\n   |  14th  |   10   |        |       |       |       |       |     2  |\n   |  15th  |    8   |        |       |       |       |       |     1  |\n   |  16th  |    7   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n   |  17th  |    6   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n   |  18th  |    5   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n   |  19th  |    4   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n   | 20-49  |    3   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n   | 50-59  |    2   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n   |  100+  |    1   |        |       |       |       |       |        |\n\nEXAMPLE: If a rider comes in at 5th place in a stage, he gets 40 points. If there was a Category 1 race in that stage, where he finished as number 2, he gets another 24 points. So, 64 points in total. (This total gets multiplied with a factor, based on which class of riders he is, see above).   \n\n#### Scoring for team directors   \nA team director will score points if a rider from his team gets into the top 5 on a stage. Team directors will only get points for his best rider, if he has more than one rider in the top 5. This way, there will always be 5 team directors who gets points from a stage. We just go down the list until we have 5 riders from 5 different teams.   \n\n  \n   | Place  | Finish | \n   |: ---------|----------- |\n   |   1st  |   320  |\n   |   2nd  |   200  |\n   |   3rd  |   120  |\n   |   4th  |    80  |\n   |   5th  |    40  |\n \nThere is no multiplication for points scored by team directors.",

Register before Friday Sept 9th at 02:20 CEST and compete for the guaranteed prize pool of £10,000 (progressive)! Manage your team of talented athletes as best as you can throughout the season, and become an NFL champion! \n\n**Buy-in**   \nThe buy-in is £10. For each entry, £8.40 goes into the prize pool. In euro: €11.77 with €9.88 going into the prize pool.\n\n**Format**   \nYour starting budget to build a 9-player squad is 135M. You must have 1 Quarterback,1 Tight End, 3 Wide Receivers, 2 Running Backs, 1 Defense Special Team, and 1 FLEX. Flex positions can be WR or RB, or TE. (QB and DST are not options for the FLEX positions.)\n\nYou can choose a maximum of 3 players from the same club. If a player is traded to a different club and you end up with 4 players as a result of this, you will receive points for all 4. However, the next time you make changes to your team, you MUST sell one of the four, as the system will not let you store a new team that violates the max 3 players per club rule. \n\n**2 Free transfers**   \nThere are two free transfers allowed between each gameweek. It is not possible to save more than 1 transfer, so the maximum amount of free transfers you can have at any time is 3. If you don’t use your free transfers one week, you can do three free transfers the following week. Any additional transfers will cost your team -8 fantasy points each. \n\n**1 wildcard**   \nA wildcard is a tool that allows you to make unlimited transfers for the next gameweek. An activated wildcard will remove all the penalty points from transfers previously made in the same gameweek. There will be only one wild card for the entire season. Once you have activated a wildcard, you cannot cancel it. You do not have to make all your changes in one session, while you have an active wildcard. You can make unlimited changes before the gameweek deadline.   \n\n**Deadline for changes**    \nThe deadline for team changes is each Gameweek’s kick-off. This means you cannot make any transfers to your lineup for the current gameweek after this time. \n\n**Price changes**   \nPlayer prices will change only twice during the season. Firstly, after GW6 and secondly, after GW12.\n\n**Maximum number of entries per player**   \nIt is not allowed for a participant to have more than 10 entries.   \n\n**Late registration: No**   \nIt will be not possible to enter this tournament after the deadline of GW1.   \n\n**Prizes: £10,000 gtd prize pool**   \nThe standard prize ladder will be used to generate the prizes. First prize will be at least 10%. Approximately 20 percent of the field will be paid. The exact amount for a place will depend on how many entries there are, but we guarantee that the payouts will at least amount to £10,000 - even if the entries number is smaller than needed to cover the guarantee. If we get more entries than needed, the prize pool will of course be expanded accordingly. You can check the final payout of the tournament once it has started.   \n\n**Standard American football scoring rules**   \nThis tournament uses the scoring rules you are used to from daily fantasy American football.

        "some_answer_fantasy_41": "### €20,000 NBA Regular Season game 2022/23   \n\nOur NBA season game is back for the new season, with a brand new twist! Forget the overwhelming daily Gameweeks that required you to be on top of the news and play the day-to-day schedule for 6+ months!   \nWith our new setup, Gameweeks have become weekly, with the transfer deadlines being every Monday, and only the best score of the week counts for each player!   \n\n### Cost and Prizes   \nThe entry cost for the tournament is set at €11, with €9.24 contributing to the prize pool for each entry.   \nEach user is allowed to enter up to 10 entries.   \nThe prize pool will be a minimum of €20,000 Guaranteed with a progressive structure. This means that if more than 2,165 teams are entered, the prize pool will grow accordingly, with no limit on how many teams can enter the contest.   \n\n### The setup: 25 Weekly Gameweeks   \nStarting with this season, NBA will work in a similar fashion to our season games for other sports. Each calendar week is now a separate Gameweek, with teams playing multiple games during the week.   \nMondays are the key days of the week for this game. Every Gameweek starts with Monday’s games and ends with Sunday’s games. If there are no matches scheduled on a Monday, then Tuesday will mark the start of that Gameweek.  \n\n### New feature: Best score counts   \nAs the NBA schedule will see teams playing anywhere between 2 to 5 games per week each, we had to develop a way to ensure that “playing the schedule” by maximizing matches per team is not the dominant strategy.   \nFor this reason, we are introducing a new rule that will ensure that each fantasy team scores points for the same amount of matches. “Best score counts” looks for the highest score of a player in a Gameweek among all the matches that he plays, so each player will get points for one match only per Gameweek.   \n\nFor example, the LA Lakers play 3 matches in Gameweek 1. If LeBron James scores 31 fantasy points in his first match, takes a rest in the second (0 points), and scores 55 points in the third match, then his score for the Gameweek will be 55 points (the best performance).   \n\n### The format: 9 players   \nThe format of your squad will remain the same as in the previous season. You have to pick 9 players in total: 2 Point Guards, 2 Shooting Guards, 2 Small Forwards, 2 Power Forwards, and 1 Center.  \nThere is no bench, no captains, and you can own a maximum of 3 players from each team.   \n\n### Free Transfers: 1 per week   \nEach Gameweek you will be granted 1 Free Transfer to use on your team. This season, there is no limit on how many unused Free Transfers you can save up for later Gameweeks.   \nYou can go above the number of free transfers you have, but additional transfers carry a penalty of -12 fantasy points per transfer.   \n\n### Wildcard: 1   \nA Wildcard enables you to make unlimited transfers in a Gameweek, for no additional cost.   \nThere is one wildcard available, which can be used at any time.   \nPlease note that activating a wildcard will reset your Free Transfers balance, so you will lose any unused transfers when you enable it.   \n\n### Player price changes   \nThis season, changes in players' prices will happen on a weekly basis. Price changes will happen every Thursday, except during the first week and the week of the All-Star break. We may also decide not to change prices in case of a week with a major interruption in the schedule.   \nThere will be up to 20 price rises and 20 price drops per week. The maximum change per player will be 0.5M. Price changes will be based on recent performance and the expected performance in the upcoming days.   \n\n### Safety net is enabled   \nYour player got injured and didn't compete? Don't worry! This season the safety net for basketball is enabled for the season game.   \nIf a player doesn't participate at all during the Gameweek, he will be automatically replaced by a player from the same position, with an equal or lower price. Replacement players will be selected from any team, ensuring of course that you never have more than 3 players from each team.   \n\n### Postponed & Abandoned matches   \nWith the new weekly setup, these cases will be much less impactful to the season game. Any game that is not played at all will be moved to a later Gameweek according to the NBA schedule. If a match is abandoned mid-game, and not completed at a later date, the players will keep the points they accumulated up to the point of the interruption.   \n\n### No Late Registration - Deadline October 18th\nMake sure that you enter the contest in time because this year there will be no Late Registration period!   \nTuesday night (October 18th) is the day to mark on your calendar. Draft your team that night, as the NBA Season starts with the Boston Celtics - Philadelphia 76ers match in the AM hours (19th - 01:30 CET).",
        "some_answer_matchups_0": "1. In order to submit a Matchup coupon, the user needs to select a minimum of 3 duels and maximum 10 duels.\n\n2. Once the user enters the buy-in amount, the payout ladder will be displayed and the payouts are fixed. User can choose a buy-in amount ranging from €10 to €500.\n\n3. Scoring: The points accumulated in the duel will be based on the player’s performance in the real game. The player with the higher fantasy points score at the end of the game wins the duel. If the score is equal, the player with the asterisk (*) wins the duel.\n\n4. In order to win a Matchup coupon, all the duels selected by the user needs to be correct. For example: If the user selects 10 duels in a Matchup, then, in order to win the Matchup, the user needs to win all the 10 duels. PLEASE NOTE THAT EVEN IF ONE OF THE DUELS SELECTED IS INCORRECT, THE MATCHUP IS LOST AND DOESN’T QUALIFY FOR THE PAYOUT.\n\n5. Once all games in a Matchup betslip are completed, the winnings will be automatically paid out to the user after 2-20 minutes (confirmation period).\n\n6. A duel involving football players will be cancelled if at least one player did not start the game. A duel involving athletes in any other sport will be cancelled if at least one athlete did not play at all. In other words, if a football player does not start the game, but enters later on in the game, that duel will be cancelled. For example: If the number of duels selected by the user is 4, and one of the duels is cancelled due to a player not starting or not playing in the match, then the number of duels in the Matchup will be reduced to 3 and the payout will be based on 3 duels. If all duels in a matchup are cancelled, the buy-in will be refunded.\n\n7. To check your Matchup results, please follow the below steps:\n– Choose “My Entries” in the top menu\n- Choose \"Running\" or \"Ended\"\n– Choose \"Player matchup\" section\n– Choose the coupon you want to check\n\n8. A Matchup can be a combination of duels from several different sports. Please read the fantasy scoring system for each sport to make sure you are informed correctly.",

If you bet €10 on a combination of 10 duels and you get all duels right, the pay-out will be a whopping €5,000! You can easily see how big the pay-out will be, when you add more duels to your coupon.",

If you select 4 duels, you need to pick 4 winners in order to get the pay-out. One mistake is enough to make a coupon a losing one.",
        "some_answer_matchups_6": "If one or both of the players in a duel did not start the game, that particular duel will be cancelled, and the prize ladder will move down 1 step. In other words, if a player does not start the game, but enters later on in the game, that duel will be cancelled. If you originally had selected 4 duels and the opponent of your pick in one of the duels did not start the match, you now have 3 duels, and the potential pay-out has been reduced in accordance to the prize ladder.\n\nIn basketball: If one or both of the players in a duel did not play a second in the match, the duel will be cancelled.",

By using our sports betting products, the customer agrees to follow the general rules for sports betting as outlined in this chapter, and all other rules on the site that may apply.   \n\n2. The customer must be over 18 years old in order to have a valid account for sports betting. If a customer has been found to place bets while not being at least 18 years old, the account will be closed and funds confiscated.   \n\n3. The customer must supply correct information about personal status, such as (but not limited to) name, date of birth and address. If a customer has been found to give false information in this area, the account may be disabled and funds confiscated.   \n\n4. Only one account is allowed per customer. Should we identify customers with more than one account, we will close all but the original account and confiscate the funds associated with the additional accounts.   \n\n5. We reserve the right to refuse registration, suspend, limit or terminate an account for a particular person for any reason. This can happen for example if fraud or cheating is involved.   \n\n6. If we incur any charge-backs, or other charges related to a customer’s account, we reserve the right to charge the account the relevant amounts.   \n\n7. We reserve the right to decline any bet requested at our sole and absolute discretion.   \n\n8. Once a bet has been placed, it cannot be cancelled by the customer. It is the customer’s responsibility to check details of the bet carefully prior to placing it.   \n\n9. If there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same selections, having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, we reserve the right to make bets void or withhold payment, pending the outcome of an investigation.   \n\n10. If there is evidence of manipulation of a sports outcome, for example by match fixing, we reserve the right to make bets void or withhold payment, pending the outcome of an investigation.   \n\n11. We will not be liable for any errors in respect of bets, such as (but not limited to) if a bet has been offered with odds set too high or low by an obvious mistake, such bets will be cancelled. The cancellation can happen before, during, or after the event.   \n\n12. If a pre-match bet has been accepted after the event has started, it will stand, provided the outcome is not known, and that no participant has gained a significant advantage. If the outcome is known or an advantage is present, we reserve the right to void any bets in this market.   \n\n13. If a bet has been settled based on an official result and the official result is changed at a later time, the settlements of the event will not be reversed.   \n\n14. If a bet has been settled based on erroneous decision(s) by us and this is discovered within 24 hours of the event finishing, we will aim to resolve the situation in the fairest way for everyone involved.   \n\n15. If a match is postponed, bets will only stand if the match is played the same day. If it is clear that the match will not be played the same day, bets will be voided.   \n\n16. If a bet is voided for some reason, the stake will be returned to the customer if it is a single bet. If it is part of multiple (parlay/system), it will be declared as “won” but with odds of 1.00.   \n\n17. If a match is interrupted before full-time, there are additional rules:\na) If the match is resumed and completed within 48 hours of the original starting time, all bets will stand.\nb) Markets that have both a winning and a losing side at the time of the interruption can be settled when it is clear that the match will not be completed in the 48 hour window. Bets in other markets will be voided in this situation.\nAn example of a bet with a winning and losing side is “total goals over 2.5” if there have been three goals in the match, because the “under” bets have lost at this point. (However, with three goals in the match, the over/under 3.5 market does not have both a winning side and a losing side and cannot be settled, so bets will be voided). If there is an “anytime goalscorer” market with a bet on Kane, and he has scored before the match was interrupted, that bet wins, while a bet on Lacazette in this market loses if he has not scored by the time the match was interrupted.   \n\n18. A bet on a player in multi-selection player markets like “anytime goalscorer” or “first goalscorer” will be cancelled if the player does not start the match.   \n\n19. If there is a tie between some of the selections in a market, the pay-out is dependent on how many selections that ties for the win and the odds for the selection. The pay-out will be calculated by this formula: P1 = (S1/t) x O1 where P1 = Pay-out user 1, S1 = Stake User 1, t = number of selections that ties for the win and O1 = Odds for User 1’s selection to win. Example: If a user bets 100 euro on Zaha to get the most fantasy points at odds of 4.00, and Aguero gets exactly the same amount of points, while the third selection loses, the user will get a pay-out of 100/2 x 4 = 200 euro for Zaha. For Aguero at odds of 1.80 the pay-out would be 100/2 x 1.80 = 90).   \n\n20. The maximum amount that is possible to bet is defined by the us specifically for each event and each type of bet and is subject to change without prior written notice.   \n\n21. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to determine what the minimum and maximum bet selection is for each bet and to restrict stakes/bets from an account. Bets/stakes limits will be made clear on our website at the time you place your bet(s). This decision is only taken after due consideration and the decision will not be reversed.   \n\n22. If your player got the most fantasy points but at the same time 1 or more players also got the same number of points, the bet will declared as won but with odds 1.00.   \n\n23. Bets will be settled up to 30 min after there is a result for the bet. But as a rule bets are paid out almost immediately. For example, bet on market OVER 0.5 will be settled up to 30 minutes after first goal was scored.",

You incur a stackingpenalty if you have more than one defensive player (defender or goalkeeper) that gets a clean sheet, from the same club. The penalty will increase by 1 for each additional such player. So, if you have 3 defensive \nplayers from the same club, they will get penalties of 0, -1, -2.

If you have four doubles and two triples, the number of combinations will be 2x2x2x2x3x3=144. This system costs €14.4.\n\n#### Can I participate even if I don't know the teams?   \nYes! Click on the 'autocomplete' button and we will create a coupon for you! You can choose how many combinations such a coupon will have, by selecting the appropriate system in the drop-down menu. If you want to, you can add your own selections to the autocomplete coupon.\n\n#### How do I see what other entrants have played?   \nIf you check the 'Show community picks' option, you will see how many percent that have selected the various outcomes. You will not be allowed to see other entrants’ coupons.\n\n#### What happens if a match is postponed?   \nIf a match is not played at the scheduled time, the result will be decided by a random draw. The draw will be weighted, which means that the chance of drawing a certain outcome is proportional to the percentage of total combinations in the pool that have picked the outcome. The same happens if a match is interrupted and not finished on the same day.",
        "prizes_helptext": "Get all matches correct as the only user, and you win the jackpot!\n\nThe pay-out for each prize group depends on how many combinations that got that amount of outcomes are right.",
        "gamerules_content": "1. Make 1, 2 or 3 selections (1X2) per match.\n\n2. If you make 2 selections in a match the number of combinations will double. If you make 3 selections it will triple.\n\n3. The price per combination is €0,1.\n\n4. The lowest price for a coupon is €0,1. (Only 1 selection per match.)\n\n5. There is a progressive jackpot in this game. In order to win it you need to be the only one who predicted correctly the outcome in all matches. If more than one player qualifies for the jackpot, the jackpot will be moved to the next coupon.\n\n75% of the turnover will be distributed to 13, 12, 11 and 10 correct outcomes this way:\n\n| Prize distribution |\n| :-- | --: |\n| 13 correct | 45% |\n| 12 correct | 17% |\n| 11 correct | 15% |\n| 10 correct | 23% |\n\n10% of the turnover will go towards the jackpot. (5% will be used as downpayment on the €500, and 5% will be used to grow the jackpot over €500.)"
