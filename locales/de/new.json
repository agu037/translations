    "universal_note": "This is our new Universal 6 format for football. Choose 6 players from any position, while staying inside the budget. Captains and Vice-captains score 1.5x and 1.2x more, but they also cost 50% and 20% more respectively! Safety net and stacking penalty still apply.",
    "any5.basket_note": "This is the new pursuit mode! Now you can directly see each playerâ€™s bonus points next to their name. You can still pick any players you like, and the sum of their bonus points will show on the top bar like before. Players can have positive (+) or negative (-) bonus points. Captains (x2) and Vice-Captains (1.5x) will have their bonus points and total points multiplied by 2 and 1.5."
